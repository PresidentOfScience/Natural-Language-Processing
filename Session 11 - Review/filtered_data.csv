A Walk to Remember,Too-syrupy re-tread of Love Story.,NEGATIVE
A Wrinkle in Time,This colossal springboard from the family film of teen issues to the epic intergalactic adventure &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; desires to be is more than a little haphazard&#46;,NEGATIVE
A Wrinkle in Time,"The film's visual and tonal approach has been pushed to erratic limits, overriding and distracting from the characters at its center.",NEGATIVE

Abominable,"The story of Everest and the kids is sweet without being saccharine. It doesn't leave much room for a layered story or smart jokes to keep the parents entertained. The jokes are largely geared towards kids, and most are of the farting or vomiting variety.",POSITIVE
Abominable,"Simple messages on grief, loss and perseverance (""When things get tough you just keep going,"" Yi says helpfully.) provide an emotional subtext but it's the film's light touch and visuals that pack the biggest punch.",POSITIVE
About Adam,"Charming, explicit love story for mature teens.",POSITIVE
About Adam,"It's smart, it knows its audience can join dots and it actually makes you think about - and not just laugh at - the messes that people get themselves in over four letters.",POSITIVE
About Adam,"An airy, accented romantic comedy romp of infidelity and animal attraction [that hinges on] your personal threshold for average, of-the-moment romantic comedies.",NEGATIVE
About Adam,It seems like several articles from FHM all rolled up into one. At least just reading the articles would have been a lot more entertaining.,NEGATIVE

Admission,"If Admission had become an edgier film, I have a strange feeling that we'd be watching yet another really great Tina Fey comedy.",NEGATIVE

Aeon Flux,What is it that drives talented actresses to dive into a hot pile of cinematic crap soon after winning their first Oscar?,NEGATIVE
Aeon Flux,Even Theron's sexy catsuit acrobatics can't prevent boredom from setting in as the film's unimaginative production design and dull dialogue take precedence.,NEGATIVE
After Earth,Regardless of the potential here&#44; a neutral&#44; lifeless tone prevails over every aspect&#44; from the direction to the acting to the special FX&#44; but especially the dull script by M&#46; Night Shyamalan and Gary Whitta&#46;,NEGATIVE

After Earth,"The film's potent scenes of lachrymosity make the voyage worthwhile, at least until the unimaginative monster shows up.",POSITIVE
After Earth,"An indecipherably inert action flick sees out-of-form director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense) stuck in the same snoozy rut as his worst film, the notorious The Last Airbender.",NEGATIVE

After the Sunset,...a fluffy time-killer.,POSITIVE

Agent Cody Banks,I have a feeling Muniz could have done much more with this role under the right director and with a better script.,NEGATIVE
Agent Cody Banks,"The Bond films never feel dated, and neither does Agent Cody Banks. It still plays well, and for that credit the special effects that compare favorably to today's films and the fact that high school never seems to change.",POSITIVE

Ali,[Michael Mann] successfully recreates an era on screen and provides a great introduction to the fighter that is not clouded by sentimentality.,POSITIVE
Ali,"Will Smith takes the wise and sensible option of not trying to impersonate Ali per se, but rather tonally build an impression of Ali from his own natural register.",POSITIVE
Ali,"While making a great looking biopic that is filled with detail, Michal Mann forgot to make a film that entertains, creating an emotionally void, tone flat portrait of an athlete whose contribution socially and culturally has yet to be matched.",NEGATIVE
Alien Resurrection,"Not as accomplished as [Aliens], but a vast improvement over the third entry. More a series of horrific rides than a work with emotional resonance. ",POSITIVE
Alien Resurrection,"What could have an after-thought that ruined the series’ credibility was actually not only a surprisingly enjoyable romp, but also rather thought-provoking.",POSITIVE

All the King's Men,There's a good movie in here somewhere but Zaillian's muddied storytelling and lack of focus hides it beyond recall.,NEGATIVE
All the King's Men,"All the King's Men is a dull movie, mainly due to the fact that it is full of boring characters which are poorly written by writer/director Steven Zaillian and led by an underwhelming Jude Law.",NEGATIVE

Almost Christmas,"Almost Christmas isn't a brilliant film, though it's an entertaining and satisfying one.",POSITIVE

Almost Christmas,You'll get through this movie and laugh a little but really going with the cast that's there you should be laughing way more.,NEGATIVE

Ambulance,Everything he does is still about big explosions&#44; big guns&#44; big stakes&#44; big car chases&#44; big actors&#44; big cameras&#46; The only thing not big in this movie is the drones they use to fly around random places in Los Angeles&#46;,NEGATIVE
Ambulance,One of Michael Bay is better action thrillers in years&#33; Yahya &amp; Gyllenhaal sell me on their brotherly relationship &amp; every reaction decision they make from the start&#46; It is engaging&#44; entertaining &amp; action packed with a finish line which works in Bay is favor,POSITIVE
Ambulance,"High on the blam-blam-blam and low on the yak-yak-yak, this is the big-screen barrage of suddenly shattering windows, improbably airborne vehicles and impressively exploding objects you’ve been waiting for.",POSITIVE

American Made,&quot;American Made&quot; is southern-fried Scorsese Lite&#44; a gumbo of decadent deviance masking over a sharp spice of potentially fatal risks&#46;,POSITIVE
American Made,"Regardless of its exciting story and sharp ending, the film contains almost no lasting consequence and feels more like an adventure than the story of a real-world scandal, rather troublingly so.",NEGATIVE

American Made,"Despite a strong Tom Cruise performance, the movie is as generic as its title.",NEGATIVE

American Psycho,"Expertly made and does what it's trying to do very well, but I just can't fully connect with this one.",POSITIVE
American Psycho,The idea that this is all a fantasy inside Bateman's head is brilliantly realised in his growing realisation that he's been able to get away with all of this in plain sight.,POSITIVE
American Sniper,Eastwood and Hall construct a very cinematic&#44; romantic tale that leaves little to question&#59; though reality&#44; as always&#44; is far more intricate and certainly not as black-and-white&#46; As the saying goes&#44; &quot;When the legend becomes fact&#44; print the legend&#46;&quot;,NEGATIVE

An Unfinished Life,There's something strangely poignant about watching Robert Redford trying to be Clint Eastwood.,NEGATIVE
An Unfinished Life,"A wistful smalltown drama, this is predictable and pleasant, with enjoyable performances. It suffers from heavy-handed symbolism, but as an undemanding mainstream movie it has its simple pleasures.",POSITIVE
Analyze That,"Once again, Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro play off each other with successful, clashing comedic personalities.",NEGATIVE
Analyze That,Analyze That is even funnier than Analyze This.,POSITIVE

Angel-A,"The film settles into a laid-back groove that is, how shall we say, endlessly boring.",NEGATIVE
Angel-A,"The film is slickly constructed with a hip soundtrack and art direction, but its empty, a glowing travelogue for a beautiful city and two maudlin characters that are predictable and two dimensional. I love Paris too but would rather see its reality ....",POSITIVE
Angel-A,"A gorgeous-looking film whose crisp, black-and-white photography is unfortunately much more thrilling than its simplistic, cloying story.",NEGATIVE
Anna,Besson is new film is an overly smug repackaging of his most acclaimed work&#44; La Femme Nikita&#46;,NEGATIVE

Annabelle: Creation,"While defusing laughter often accompanies this sort of material, it's best employed when we're not laughing at the film.",NEGATIVE
Annabelle: Creation,While Annabelle&#58; Creation is not on the level of James Wans The Conjuring&#44; the film is still able to stand on its own as a chilling film that not only cements David F&#46; Sandberg as one of horrors best directors today&#46;,POSITIVE
Annabelle: Creation,"Good characters, a different viewpoint on the scares, excellent direction, and some nice nods for fans of the series.",POSITIVE
Annapolis,"Annapolis has the seeds of a good, if derivative, film in it, but gives that up in favor of being a mediocre boxing film.",NEGATIVE

Another Year,"Another Year, though not an important piece of Leigh's oeuvre, is still a highly enjoyable one.",POSITIVE

Ant-Man and The Wasp,Ant-Man And The Wasp is still one of the best entries in the MCU so far and it checks off all the boxes of what an Ant-Man Sequel should be&#46; It is funny&#44; charming&#44; emotional&#44; and has some fantastic action scenes&#46;&#46;&#46;,POSITIVE

Argo,Argo is an extremely impressive and well-crafted political thriller that would carry a resonance even without the timely present happenings&#46;,POSITIVE

Armageddon,In a cross between &#8220;Independence Day&#8221; and &#8220;Apollo 13&#44;&#8221; &#8220;Armageddon&#8221; leans more heavily toward the former&#46; Piles of visual effects with a weak plot to keep it all tied together and give them the excuse to make the film&#46;,NEGATIVE

"As Above, So Below","Any inventiveness of As Above So Below wears off early on, but one would be remiss to not credit the film with at least generating a few scares, even if it doesn't live up to its potential.",NEGATIVE
Assassination Tango,"He's an old assassin, she's a young local dancing hottie, and they mix dance, lust and guns.",NEGATIVE
Assassination Tango,It is a form of condescension that Duvall could only perpetrate while being blinded by true love.,NEGATIVE
Assassination Tango,"It's slow, but it's also sure-footed. Duvall takes it at his own damn pace, and his grouchy old man of a contract killer is a well-rounded and wholly believable personage.",NEGATIVE
Assassination Tango,More a song about living and dying well than a picture that makes much sense in the traditional definition.,POSITIVE

Assault on Precinct 13,"If you are going to remake a cult film classic, it darn well ought to be better than the original. Jean-Francois Richet apparently ignored this tidbit of Filmmaking 101 wisdom when he was putting together Assault on Precinct 13.",NEGATIVE

Asylum,The film wryly wonders whether the lunatics have taken over not just the asylum but the entire world as well.,POSITIVE
At Any Price,"Very soapy, sorta dopey father-son drama.",NEGATIVE
At Any Price,"The rising temperature never really ignites. There's conflicts aplenty, but things simmer without ever quite coming to the boil.",NEGATIVE
At Any Price,[At Any Price] is a lot more surprising -- and a lot smarter -- than you might expect.,POSITIVE
At Any Price,What At Any Price does for the American farming system in the 21st century is what chocolate cupcakes do for the nutrition movement - absolutely nothing but serves as another preposterous obstacle to ponder. Price is one less crop to consider harvesting,NEGATIVE
Atanarjuat the Fast Runner,Where the ideas behind the film and its production are inspired and speak to the sheer determination of the filmmakers behind it&#44; the viewing experience of the film is rather lackluster&#46;,POSITIVE
Atanarjuat the Fast Runner,"The ever-changing light and stark sea of ice become characters in themselves. Indeed, the making of Fast Runner is fascinating in itself. Outtakes of the production run with the end credits; they're worth sticking around for.",POSITIVE

Atanarjuat the Fast Runner,...takes you to a place you've never been and tells a story as profound and ambitious as a Shakespeare play.,POSITIVE

Atomic Blonde,The talented cast and formal technique feel trampled by the overstylized and undermotivated narrative.,POSITIVE
Atomic Blonde,A textbook example of style over substance.,POSITIVE

Atonement,"This level of storytelling and artistry is a rare treat, demonstrating director Joe Wright's knack for working with adapted material.",POSITIVE
Atonement,"Joe Wright (director) and Christopher Hampton (writer) have not only built an exciting epic from the book, but also provide the visual discovery of an ending that was already outstanding in the novel, but... reaches new heights. [Full review in Spanish]",POSITIVE
Atonement,"McAvoy, long an underrated actor and also a Golden Globe nominee, fares even better here as the wrongly accused Robbie.",POSITIVE
Atonement,Where Wright does succeed is in making absolutely lucid McEwan's fascinating central theme of atonement.,POSITIVE

Auto Focus,The technical aspects of the film are quite on the money.,POSITIVE
Auto Focus,"The film isn't the least bit erotic, or prurient - or even interesting.",NEGATIVE

Autumn in New York,...the feel of an old-school weeper...,NEGATIVE
Autumn in New York,A banal and sappy romantic melodrama,NEGATIVE
Autumn in New York,"To sit through this is to suffer the grossest sweaty-palms-on-the-glass sex scene. Funny that the film closes with an overbearing end-credits song by Jennifer Paige - a one-hit wonder who, like ""Autumn,"" is a pop-culture footnote best left forgotten.",NEGATIVE
Autumn in New York,Weak and unmemorable.,NEGATIVE

Away From Her,"No one dreams of the twilight transpiring in ""Away From Her,"" but, in its words, it's not bad luck. It's just life. You can't beat life. A tenderly told tragedy about Alzheimer's Disease's erosive effects, Sarah Polley's film avoids movie-of-the-week sap.",POSITIVE
Baby Boy,"The film is a bold examination of an aspect of African American life. There's no shortage of sex, violence, or urban realism.",POSITIVE
Baby Boy,This is yet another coming-of-age tale except that the hero is not a teenager but a young man who goes out of his way to be macho but really is a mama boy.,POSITIVE
Baby Boy,"Recommended mainly to the more devoted Singleton fans, Baby Boy is pretty strong evidence of a filmmaker who still has plenty to say.",POSITIVE
Baby Boy,"...while it's not as gritty as Boyz N the Hood or as compelling as Higher Learning, Baby Boy is certainly worth checking out if only for the superb performances...",POSITIVE
Baby Driver,"Baby Driver's comparatively small, handmade quality serves it well, making this kinetic piece of entertainment feel less like an anonymous studio tentpole than a personal labor of love.",POSITIVE

Bad Boys II,"It still won't impress your granny with its excessive violence, colourful language and repeated unpleasantness, but Bad Boys II is two-and-a-half hours of total Bayhem.",POSITIVE
Bad Boys II,"There is some fun to be had in the outrageous mayhem, particularly with yet more chase sequences (repetitious as they may be).",NEGATIVE
Bad Boys II,"A monument to excess both exhausting and entertaining, Bad Boys II challenges audiences to withstand 2.5 hours of stamina-sapping ""Bayhem,"" but benefits from the heightened, almost surreal vulgarity at its core.",POSITIVE

Bad Education,"A dazzling autobiographical blend of Almodovar's career, childhood, and adoration & admiration for the cinema.",POSITIVE
Bad Moms,MILF (Movie I'd Like to Forget).,NEGATIVE
Bad Moms,"Because Kunis, Bell and especially Hahn are such game comedians, they find a way to make it feel fresh.",POSITIVE
Bad Moms,"The movie has laughs, mostly courtesy of Hahn's laser sharp delivery but mostly this is a manifesto for taking a breath and giving both yourself and your kids a chance to enjoy their childhoods.",POSITIVE
Bad Moms,There are just too many sweeping stereotypes here to take aim at and I simply don't have the time nor will to live to bother.,NEGATIVE
Bad News Bears,Delights in confronting - and stomping on - the kind of political correctness that simply didn't exist in 1976 when the first one was made,NEGATIVE
Bad News Bears,An amiable enough remake of the 1976 classic that is helped greatly by some very funny work by Billy Bob Thornton.,POSITIVE
Bad News Bears,"Bad News Bears finds Linklater marking time professionally enough -- and while hardly essential viewing, it's unpretentious, amoral fun.",POSITIVE
Bad News Bears,"It's no Bad Santa, but it's fun.",POSITIVE
Bad Santa 2,"While the foul language, misanthropic attitude, and cynical performances still come into focus, even squinting might not pick up much in the way of the first film's clever plotting, genuine wit, and sneaky subversive streak running throughout.",NEGATIVE
Bad Santa 2,"A bevy of supporting roles provide almost no real laughs, despite the fact that they're added solely for comic relief.",NEGATIVE
Bad Santa 2,There's something genuinely awesome and genuinely awful about a film in which the leading characters all are relentlessly cruel to one another yet.,POSITIVE
Bad Santa 2,"Despite choice casting and returning core characters, this yuletide formula is missing the requisite spice to reach the same heights of comedic arousal.",NEGATIVE

Bad Teacher,"It's a daring character to build a comedy around, and luckily, as good as Diaz is, she is leading a well cast ensemble.",POSITIVE
Bad Teacher,"Timberlake plays against type as a rather timid, bookish wallflower whose funniest scenes seem to be making fun of his reputation.",POSITIVE
Bad Teacher,"It isn't horrible, but it also isn't anything that you need to run out and see.",NEGATIVE
Bad Times at the El Royale,Goddard deftly maneuvers his unconventional narrative while playing with time&#44; tinkering with points of view&#44; and tossing in a MacGuffin or two&#46;,POSITIVE
Bad Times at the El Royale,"Goddard;s script, which on the surface could be accused of selling an angle more than a narrative, nonetheless allows the actors several leisurely moments to chew scenery or simply inhabit their roles.",POSITIVE
Bad Times at the El Royale,Episode 12: Away We Go,POSITIVE
Bad Times at the El Royale,It all looks phony and sounds artificial from side to side.,NEGATIVE
Baggage Claim,There are laughs to be found in Baggage Claim but they most definitely come at the expense of anything resembling reality.,NEGATIVE
Baggage Claim,"Talbert sneaks in a few funny one-liners and genuinely touching scenes, but he mostly seems content to keep Montana scurrying through a meaningless maze of boring rom-com cliches.",NEGATIVE
Baggage Claim,"Though silly and far-fetched, Baggage Claim remains an enjoyable romp, mostly due to its ensemble's energetic playing and writer/director David E. Talbert's breathless pacing.",POSITIVE
Baggage Claim,"Honestly, I don't know what to say about this movie, because it feels so phenomenally old-fashioned and outdated, so ridiculously conservative and undermining of female independence.",NEGATIVE

Bamboozled,"It works overtime to throw the audience off balance, to alienate us in almost Brechtian fashion, holding us at arm's length but demanding our attention as if saying ""don't look away, you need to see this.""",POSITIVE
Bamboozled,"Believe it or not, Bamboozled is a comedy, even if a dark one. Lee makes sure that there are plenty of laughs, even if he's poking the audience at the same time to wonder why they are laughing.",POSITIVE
Bandits,"Tries hard to be a quirky comedy -- God, does it try.",NEGATIVE
Bandits,"Adults will get this movie, but kids won't.",POSITIVE
Bandits,"Terrible. A substitute for sleep medication that's so self-indulgent and plodding, it drove four people out of my screening midway through.",NEGATIVE

Bangkok Dangerous,No frills at all [on the DVD release} and a marketing attempt to garner some extra revenue by capitalizing on the [upcoming] Nic Cage version.,POSITIVE
Bangkok Dangerous,Doesn't make much of a lasting impression except as a case study in the dreariness of style-over-substance filmmaking when said style is the height of derivativeness.,NEGATIVE
Bangkok Dangerous,...an old-as-the-hills hit man story jazzed up by flashy visuals and a charismatic turn by the very good looking lead.,NEGATIVE
Bangkok Dangerous,The poorly worked plot and lack of decent dialogue makes you wonder if the title Bangkok Monotonous isn't more appropriate.,NEGATIVE

Batman & Robin,It's not good&#44; but it's not the total disaster its legacy would suggest&#46; As an ode to the Silver Age of the Caped Crusader&#44; it gets a lot of things right&#44; but the pacing grinds to a halt any time one of our heroes is on screen&#46; Thank god for Uma Thurman&#46;,NEGATIVE
Batman & Robin,There's pleasure to be found in how campy Joel Schumacher's second Batman outing is &#40;puns&#33;&#41;&#44; but everyone except Thurman and Schwarzenegger are phoning their performances in&#46; Too long and too focused on toy sales&#44; this is excess&#44; but not the good kind&#46;,NEGATIVE

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,Unsatisfyingly curious.,NEGATIVE
Battle of the Sexes,"Fortunately, the film never becomes a hype machine or gets caught up in the bizarre media circus around the central match. The concentration remains on the players and the emotional stakes, as well as what King's victory represents.",POSITIVE
Battle of the Sexes,A fitting tribute to one of the biggest female sports stars of the twentieth century.,POSITIVE

Battle of the Year,"Instead of allowing his film to be uplifted by dance, Lee burdens it with a cringe-worthy dramatic narrative.",NEGATIVE
Battle of the Year,"Characters are not developed enough. You don't feel for them. Result being, you end up as mere spectators instead of well-wishers. While the film preaches 'passion' for whatever you do, it is exactly what seems to be missing from it.",NEGATIVE

Baywatch,"The antagonist goes so far as to compare herself to a Bond villain, which is an insult even to the very worst of the Bond villains.",NEGATIVE
Be Cool,"Be Cool isn't the biting satire that Get Shorty was. It's lighter, hipper, and, yes, more fun.",POSITIVE
Be Cool,"Be Cool sounds like it should be good, or at least entertaining, but it's neither. It does have some genuinely fun moments, but lacks a strong narrative to hang them off of. The result is empty, full of contrivances, and ultimately unsatisfying.",NEGATIVE
Be Cool,Watered-down sequel isn't meant for kids.,POSITIVE
Be Cool,Self-mocking jokes prevail in F. Gary Gray's feisty cinematic version of Elmore Leonard's irreverent Los Angeles based novel.,POSITIVE

Beautiful Girls,Does &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; philosophically aspire to much more than mirroring a Counting Crows lyric from &quot;Mr&#46; Jones&#63;&quot; Maybe not&#46; But there's a barroom eloquence&#44; bottle-bottomed anxiety and stumblebum sadness to it that lingers in its bones&#46;,POSITIVE
Beautiful Girls,"This film really succeeds with its warm treatment of ordinary hang-ups -- no life-shattering revelations or pain repressed since childhood, just the genuine, everyday trials of life.",POSITIVE
Beautiful People,"Vivid characters rendered impotent by a disorienting tone and a jerky, start-and-stop narrative that dilutes the film's putative emotional punch.",NEGATIVE
Beautiful People,"I have made the film sound grim. Actually it is fairly lighthearted, under the circumstances; like Catch-22, it enjoys the paradoxes that occur when you try to apply logic to war.",POSITIVE
Beautiful People,the film offers Americans an empathetic glimpse of the country we revolted against all those years ago.,POSITIVE
Beautiful People,"What it fails to do is tell a coherent story, as everything about this exaggerated tale is hopelessly lost in a sea of silliness and generalities.",NEGATIVE
Beauty and the Beast,"Rather than going back to the original fairy tale by Mme. Leprince de Beaumont and reenvisioning it, the film reformats the studios cherished animated original with actors and computer-animated special FX. It's less a remake than a replication.",NEGATIVE
Beauty and the Beast,You can add Beauty and the Beast to the list of well made Disney live-action remakes&#46; While not better than the 1991 original&#44; it is a nice representation of one of the greatest animated films ever made and more evidence that Disney can do no wrong&#46;,POSITIVE
Beauty and the Beast,"In a year in which many of the biggest hits have been little more than sops to fanboys more interested in bloodletting than storytelling, here's a film for everyone ... It manages to return a splash of magic to the movies, even if only momentarily.",POSITIVE
Beauty and the Beast,Tries to cash in on the magic without capturing what was behind that fairy dust in the first place.,NEGATIVE
Because I Said So,Never met a cliché it didn't love or a situation too hackneyed to be inserted into the mix.,NEGATIVE
Because I Said So,"This movie manages to be offensive and yet dull and predictable, as phony as a Kate Spade sidewalk knock-off bag and as unoriginal as the ready-for VH1 soundtrack.",NEGATIVE
Because I Said So,"Because I Said So seems like it's supposed to be a paean of sorts to motherhood and the enduring love that entails, a love so strong that it inevitably drives its possessor somewhat batty. But what it is, is muddled crap.",NEGATIVE
Because I Said So,The ensuing cycle of miscommunication is endless and trying.,NEGATIVE
Because of Winn-Dixie,It's a simple film and a simple story.,POSITIVE
Because of Winn-Dixie,A girl and a dog educate a small southern town.,POSITIVE
Because of Winn-Dixie,"Just the latest quasi-magic-realist, two-birds-with-one-stone shrine to non-traditional families and the power of myth",NEGATIVE
Because of Winn-Dixie,"Because of Winn-Dixie does no harm, and it should appeal to younger children while charming more than a few adults.",POSITIVE
Becky,Becky is a breezy blast and a gnarly genre gem that horrifically turns the plot of Home Alone on its head&#44; with terrific turns from Lulu Wilson and Kevin James&#46;&#10;&#10;,POSITIVE
Becky,Family drama and home invasion thriller is just a part of the genre blend we get&#46; &#8220;Becky&#8221; is just as much a revenge-fueled splatter film as the 13-year-old protagonist unleashes her sorrow and rage in a number of grisly&#44; blood-soaked ways&#46;,POSITIVE
Becky,Those hoping to see a more memorable turn from James might be disappointed&#44; but you might see a star in the making with Lulu Wilson&#44; a name you should probably remember&#46;,NEGATIVE
Becky,"The end of the movie hints at a fascinating character study that hasn't actually occurred. What Milott and Murnion do, though, they do quite well.",POSITIVE
Bedazzled,The humor is periodically immature but largely universal as Ramis garners steady laughs from cleverly orchestrated situations and efficient visuals.,POSITIVE
Bedazzled,"The leads play well together, but the secret sauce is the cheeky, twisty script by [Harold] Ramis, Peter Tolan and Larry Gelbart.",POSITIVE
Bedazzled,"This is about as simple and uncomplicated you can get, but it isn't trying to do anything beyond providing some quick and easy laughs in a refreshingly heavenly comedy.",POSITIVE
Bedazzled,Charming Fraser Faustian tale with lots of sexual innuendo.,POSITIVE
Bee Movie,"While the premise is unique, the approach is generic.",NEGATIVE
Bee Movie,"Apparently, when money talks good ideas walk.",NEGATIVE
Bee Movie,It certainly is beautiful.,POSITIVE
Bee Movie,"Its moral that even the smallest creature can make a world of difference is one to be appreciated. It is a shame, however, that it could not keep up its energetic and fun pace established within its first act.",POSITIVE
Bee Season,"A film about these shards of life experience and our often desperate attempts to collect them, assemble them, make sense of them or simply live with them without disruption.",POSITIVE
Bee Season,"No, Bee Season is just plain awful. That's right, awful, A-W-F-U-L, awful, and if that doesn't spell out my feelings succinctly I don't know what will.",NEGATIVE
Bee Season,"A visual feast, but a spiritual famine.",NEGATIVE
Bee Season,"This is second-rate Hallstrm, drama plus whimsy that, when rubbed together, creates not friction and fire, but a nubbing-down of both elements.",NEGATIVE
Before I Go to Sleep,Director Rowan Joffe has made a stylish looking movie but allows it to get bogged down by repetition and too-tame performances.,NEGATIVE
Before I Go to Sleep,I have a sneaking suspicion that the majority of you will have it figured out rather early on.,NEGATIVE
Before I Go to Sleep,The film started out slow but ended in way that didn't feel drawn out or rushed and that's pretty surprising for a film that's about hour and a half in runtime.,POSITIVE
Before I Go to Sleep,"Before I Go to Sleep is entertaining, accomplishing effectively what it sets out to do.",POSITIVE
Before Night Falls,"This could have been a compelling movie about a wonderful writer, but instead it's a tedious, pointless mess. After spending over 2 hours with Arenas, I still knew nothing about him. Javier Bardem's great performance seemed to be a complete waste.",NEGATIVE
Before Night Falls,"One of the first features about Castro's impact on artists and homosexuals, this biopic is well acted by Bardem",POSITIVE
Before Night Falls,"""Before Night Falls"" exuberantly portrays a writer whose legacy remains an acutely observant childhood spirit that no perversion of politics could break. Javier Bardem blends the swagger of Robert Downey Jr. and the brooding of a young Al Pacino.",POSITIVE
Before Night Falls,Schabel's most recent work fails to move me. While the story of Reinaldo Arenas is tragic enough to be interesting (and Javier Bardem's performance sympathetic) the film as a whole simply seems long and indulgent.,NEGATIVE
Before Sunset,The conversations flow naturally &#8211; at first as if getting to know each other again&#44; then later like two soulmates pouring their hearts out &#8211; and we never doubt that there is a real connection between these two characters&#46;,POSITIVE
Before Sunset,"This middle segment ends up being the least invigorating... Before Sunset feels a bit less substantial. Jesse and Celine play less easily off one another, their interactions clouded by adulthood, responsibility, etc.",POSITIVE
Before Sunset,Before Sunset is a joy to behold.,POSITIVE
Before Sunset,"Before Sunset is proof that practice can make perfect. Linklater not only tackles loose ends of the original with imaginative aplomb, but he also works hard to make the movie work as a standalone essay...",POSITIVE
Behind Enemy Lines,Drearily gauzed over with a blue-tinted aesthetic&#44; peppered with questionable depictions of its antagonistic forces and featuring a woefully miscast Owen Wilson in the leading role&#44; there is not a lot to admire about the film&#46;,NEGATIVE
Behind Enemy Lines,Action movie with intense peril and devastation.,POSITIVE
Behind Enemy Lines,"That's just one of many reasons why I'm reluctant to call Behind the Lines entertainment. Propaganda, MTV-style, might be closer to the truth.",NEGATIVE
Behind Enemy Lines,A satisfying enough piece of giddy-up entertainment that raises a few passing questions about the American 'cowboy mentality' before ultimately deciding it's a lot more fun to simply eat your action movie cake than try to have it too.,POSITIVE
Behind the Sun,A family blood feud between neighbors over land in the rural sugarcane fields of the Brazil of 1910.,NEGATIVE
Behind the Sun,[An] example of how old-fashioned cinema can still be quietly thrilling.,POSITIVE
Behind the Sun,"Salles' movie taps into matters that are at once ancient and mythical and, needless to say, headline-fresh.",POSITIVE
Behind the Sun,"Salles starts with the loudly trumpeted theme, then tacks on a slim plot to justify the clamour.",NEGATIVE
Being John Malkovich,The very meta tale stars and is about thespian and sometime Cambridge resident John Malkovich and the puppeteer (John Cusack) who discovers a portal into his brain.,POSITIVE
Being John Malkovich,The intense invention and creativity at work in this extraordinary movie is overwhelming.,POSITIVE
Being John Malkovich,Kaufman and Jonze steer us through a truly twisted psychological and existential swamp.,POSITIVE
Being John Malkovich,What could have developed into a one-gag film becomes a gender-bending extravaganza with a crazy network of love triangles... The real magic of Being John Malkovich is that it never fails to surprise.,POSITIVE
Being Julia,"Annette Bening is great, but this isn't for kids.",POSITIVE
Being Julia,"A beguiling romance about an aging actress at the peak of her career who embarks on an ill-advised, illicit affair with an admirer half her age.",POSITIVE
Being Julia,"Annette Bening is the movie; her performance ... is the kind that will pop up on ""best of"" lists for years to come.",POSITIVE
Being Julia,One of the best movies from this year's Telluride Film Festival,POSITIVE
Bend It Like Beckham,"An unashamedly feel-good soccer comedy that is sharper than Cristiano Ronaldo's latest haircut, has better vision than your average linesman and is more uplifting than winning on penalties in extra time.",POSITIVE
Bend It Like Beckham,"Filmmaker Gurinder Chadha has infused Bend It Like Beckham with a feel-good, uplifting feel that generally proves difficult to resist...",POSITIVE
Bend It Like Beckham,"The film caricaturises every character, save the lead players and their sympathisers, in the most obvious manner.",NEGATIVE
Bend It Like Beckham,Superb tale of a girl's struggle for her dreams.,POSITIVE
Beowulf,"The characters up on screen seem like living, breathing people.",POSITIVE
Beowulf,"Expectedly, there are large-scale, edge-of-the seat clashes and some classic savage scenes. There are other interesting touches and some quirky emotions. It's a philosophical play on what it means to be a warrior.",POSITIVE
Beowulf,"Avary and Gaiman lay on the sexual innuendo and adultery, fleshing out the character of Beowulf into a believably unreliable narrator.",POSITIVE
Beowulf,It's a superb action flick that will have you wide-eyed in awe at its effects; just don't go expecting any kind of literary discussion.,POSITIVE
Better Luck Tomorrow,Perceptive at dramatizing moments where teenagers' performances of masculinity and maturity inadvertently melt into something more fraught and real.,POSITIVE
Better Luck Tomorrow,"Justin Lin's sleek and skillful Better Luck Tomorrow is a well-contoured fantasy, not about magical worlds, secret gardens, or Middle-earths, but about the place within where demons may lie in those who may otherwise seem to be the best of us.",POSITIVE
Better Luck Tomorrow,Incisive [and] cautionary.,POSITIVE
Better Luck Tomorrow,You could have replaced everyone in this movie with the cast of some lily-white show like Dawson's Creek and nobody would notice the difference.,NEGATIVE
Better Than Sex,The bulk of the film rests squarely on its leads and both Porter and Wenham are winning and appealing.,POSITIVE
Better Than Sex,"Absurdly threadbare.....Supposed to be darling, of course, but it's mostly a stream of flat, pedestrian or nauseatingly cute talk.",NEGATIVE
Better Than Sex,Funny and honest in tracing the way in which lust can trigger emotion even if it's not supposed to be part of the plan.,POSITIVE
Better Than Sex,An Australian film that gives new meaning to 'downunder.',POSITIVE
Beyond Borders,"Angelina, here's something to remember next time: It's better to tell us one story that makes us feel than a thousand stories that make us numb.",NEGATIVE
Beyond Borders,Important issues buried in soap opera silliness.,NEGATIVE
Beyond Borders,"Se abordar os esforços humanitários ao redor do planeta é admirável, colocá-los em segundo plano para priorizar uma história de amor é mais do que frustrante; é imperdoável.",NEGATIVE
Beyond Borders,"While most movies insist on having 'plots,' this one boldly proceeds without one, flying in the face of convention.",NEGATIVE
Beyond the Mat,"There's no need to be a fan of American wrestling to enjoy Beyond the Mat. Blaustein concentrates on the idea of people living out dreams rather than the life of a wrestler, and in doing so succeeds in showing the brutal reality behind the pantomime.",POSITIVE
Beyond the Mat,WWF documentary is OK for older teens.,POSITIVE
Beyond the Mat,"Am engrossing watch, but it's far from the most fascinating and incisive look at its subject.",POSITIVE
Beyond the Mat,A very good film that both wrestling fans and non-wrestling fans will enjoy.,POSITIVE
Beyond the Sea,"More than 10-years in the making, the movie is a labor of love from Kevin Spacey, and Kate Bosworth is superb as Darin's charming wife Sandra Dee.",POSITIVE
Beyond the Sea,"There is no doubt that Spacey does a great job of portraying the entertainer, but he's so wrapped up in this project that he fails to see that it's become a collection of musical numbers without any real heart.",NEGATIVE
Beyond the Sea,"Kevin Spacey's dedication is clear, both in his performance as Darin and in his wonderful direction",POSITIVE
Beyond the Sea,Gimmicky recounting of the crooner's life.,NEGATIVE
Bicentennial Man,"Chris Columbus -- who is undeniably skilled at making funny movies -- has the deft touch of a steamroller when it comes to serious matters of the heart, mechanical or otherwise.",NEGATIVE
Bicentennial Man,Film about robot who wants to be human is so-so.,NEGATIVE
Bicentennial Man,"Bicentennial Man is sometimes sweet, but it's also a phenomenal waste of talent, and a continuation of a Williams' trip down the wrong road.",NEGATIVE
Bicentennial Man,"Virtually every emotion, motivation, idea, character and plot point in the movie is flat and perfunctory -- except for those that carry the invisible subtitle, 'Cry, dammit!'",NEGATIVE
Big Bad Love,A well crafted directorial debut from Howard who handles this quiet tale of an artist's redemption with a firm hand.,POSITIVE
Big Bad Love,"This ambitious drama about a Vietnam vet trying to create fiction out of his troubled life and former marriage (to Debra Winger) is messy, rambling, and overlong.",NEGATIVE
Big Bad Love,Makes you wish you'd stayed at home with a book -- preferably one of Larry Brown's.,NEGATIVE
Big Bad Love,Ultimately a failed actor's piece...,NEGATIVE
Big Daddy,Though it is not as side-splittingly funny as Waterboy or Happy Gilmore&#44; it still carries universal themes that resonate today&#46;,POSITIVE
Big Daddy,Some so-so Adam Sandler for the evening.,NEGATIVE
Big Daddy,Typical Adam Sandler -- charm mixed with crude humor.,POSITIVE
Big Daddy,The heavy-handed sentimentality provokes a most violent gag reflex.,NEGATIVE
Big Fat Liar,Paul Giamatti just goes for it.,POSITIVE
Big Fat Liar,It's a feature best viewed on mute. Or not at all.,NEGATIVE
Big Fat Liar,Really likeable family comedy set in cutthroat Hollywood.,POSITIVE
Big Fat Liar,"...for a so-called comedy, there are few laughs to be had.",NEGATIVE
Big Fish,"Tim Burton's lone outstanding, heartfelt film of the last two decades may not seem like a natural fit with his horror-tinged oeuvre. But in some ways it's his most intimate, personal movie.",POSITIVE
Big Fish,"The sentiment behind the plot is sweet and endearing and the movie is an excellent example of Burton, the master filmmaker, at work.",POSITIVE
Big Fish,"If you want an offbeat, funny, touching movie then Big Fish is for you",POSITIVE
Big Fish,There's a covert tyranny in the strived-for moral behind this film which evidently sees itself as a worthy ode to the redeeming value of storytelling and the shaman art.,NEGATIVE
Big Hero 6,It's enjoyable and&#44; ultimately&#44; harmless in an affectionate way that both younger audiences and their parents will appreciate&#46;,POSITIVE
Big Hero 6,The relationship between the boy and his robot is endearing and effectively told.,POSITIVE
Big Hero 6,...there's a sentimental heartbeat and some painterly framing which mean this hugely enjoyable romp retains its unique character.,POSITIVE
Big Hero 6,There are set pieces in Big Hero 6 that rival anything from the Marvel imaginations.,POSITIVE
Big Momma's House,Funny Martin Lawrence in drag with potty jokes.,NEGATIVE
Big Momma's House,Big Momma ... manages to pull off a fairly miraculous stunt -- she turns Martin Lawrence into a sweetie-pie.,POSITIVE
Big Momma's House,"Lawrence isn't doing anything that hasn't been done before, and he's certainly not doing it any better.",NEGATIVE
Big Momma's House,"Idiotic ""comedy"" is larded with thick makeup and thin performances.",NEGATIVE
Big Trouble,"Sharp, funny movie for high schoolers and up.",POSITIVE
Big Trouble,Faithful to the events in Barry's novel&#44; lifts a good deal of his witty dialogue&#44; and recruits a proven cast of laugh-winners&#46; Why&#44; then&#44; is it so resolutely unfunny&#63;,NEGATIVE
Big Trouble,"The worst thing someone could say about ""Big Trouble"" is that it's too much like ""Get Shorty,"" which is one of the best reasons to go see the film",POSITIVE
Big Trouble,Sprawling comedy has a few laughs in it -- and the specter of recent events hanging over it.,NEGATIVE
Biker Boyz,This underdeveloped outline of a movie concerns motorcycle hustlers striving to become the &#8220;King of Cali&#8221; for reasons we can never know&#46;,NEGATIVE
Biker Boyz,"Basically this is a cheap rip-off of The Fast and the Furious, with fewer thrills, fewer spills, and two fewer wheels.",NEGATIVE
Biker Boyz,Think MTV does biker movie with great cast.,POSITIVE
Biker Boyz,"At times entertaining, but never boring. It sure could have been a lot worse.",POSITIVE
Billy Elliot,Take a twirl with Billy and you won't be disappointed.,POSITIVE
Billy Elliot,Terrific story of young ballet dancer has strong language.,POSITIVE
Billy Elliot,"The film about atypical artistic pursuits in a blue-collar community that ""The Full Monty"" sought to be. Peter Darling's choreography dexterously captures the defiance in the dancing - rage against economical and emotional repression in a motherless home.",POSITIVE
Billy Elliot,"When sticking with Billy and his inspirational story, director Stephen Daldry hits all the right steps.",POSITIVE
Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,A somewhat engaging consideration of how different people view the idea of a soldier or war itself.,NEGATIVE
Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,"Stripped of the tech wizardry, its an awkward moral maze with a lot to show but very little to say.",NEGATIVE
Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,"Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is an attempt at a different kind of storytelling, but fails on many levels, with a contradictory message behind the surface.",NEGATIVE
Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,"A bit clunky and corny, but sincerely intent on providing a realistic portrait of wartime causalities, both during and after battle.",POSITIVE
Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),"Birds of Prey is a female directed, written, and produced action flick. It’s something anyone old enough to see an R-rated movie can enjoy...",POSITIVE
Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),Next to &#91;2004's&#93; Catwoman&#44; this the most egregious example among superhero films of filmmakers warping established characters to suit their own tastes and ideas rather than giving fans what they want to pay for&#46;,NEGATIVE
Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),There's this thing about bad vs&#46; badder that does not help the stakes around anti-heroes or villains movies&#46; This film is a mix of a lot of stuff that separated could've worked&#44; but together is just incoherence&#46; &#91;Full review in Spanish&#93;,NEGATIVE
Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),Abandons the &#8220;Why so serious&#63;&#8221; tone of its &#91;DCEU&#93; predecessors and instead screams &#8220;Let is put a smile on that face&#33;&#8221;,POSITIVE
Birth,With turns of tragedy rather than suspense&#44; Glazer conceived and executes an inspired and sensitive drama that deserves reassessment as a carefully considered&#44; masterfully made film that finds a place in its viewer and lingers there like a haunting dream&#46;,POSITIVE
Birth,"What begins as a promising and provocative melodrama gradually turns into na conventional and frustrating movie, aimless and pretentious.",NEGATIVE
Birth,What were they thinking?,NEGATIVE
Birth,"Manhattan-based supernatural thriller done in the tone of ""Rosemary's Baby"" starts out strong but loses all steam in its third act.",NEGATIVE
Birthday Girl,"It's a bit of a mess, but is saved by Chaplin's sad sack portrayal of the love sick John.",POSITIVE
Birthday Girl,Uneven thriller isn't for kids. Kidman's great.,POSITIVE
Birthday Girl,"There are enough well layered performances in director/co-writer Jez Butterworth's ""Birthday Girl"" to all but compensate for the film's inept noir flirtations between romantic farce and theft thriller.",POSITIVE
Birthday Girl,"Although ""Birthday Girl"" is labeled a romantic comedy, it's not wildly funny or romantic.",POSITIVE
BlacKkKlansman,&#8220;BlacKkKlansman&#8221; is a skillfully guised epic&#44; far grander in scale than it may appear on the surface&#46; It is a film rich with metaphors and juxtapositions which we experience through the two main characters&#44; both of whom are carving out their own identities,POSITIVE
BlacKkKlansman,When Spike Lee is upside-down American flag &#40;sign of distress&#41; turns to black and white then fades away&#44; the curtain is pulled back on his audience&#46; His latest is darkly funny while still packing some walloping emotional punches along the way&#46;,POSITIVE
BlacKkKlansman,"Lee's most purely entertaining film since Inside Man in 2006, BlacKkKlansman has a timeliness that taps into an imperative national conversation.",POSITIVE
BlacKkKlansman,Perhaps Spike's broadest and most well layered joint.,POSITIVE
Black Adam,Sabbac's late-stage introduction in Black Adam does not justify the ill timing of his arrival. It only strains an already-thin plot.,NEGATIVE
Black Adam,It is NOT all doom and gloom&#44; thankfully&#46; It has a tongue placed firmly in its cheek and a sly sense of humor&#44; never allowing the movie to get too light or dark&#59; just the right amount of entertainment and humor&#46; The Rock gets to let loose&#46; ,POSITIVE
Black Adam,I thought it was enjoyable and a different take on the superhero genre&#46; But given everything happening in DC with James Gunn&#44; this story is pretty much irrelevant&#46; ,NEGATIVE
Black Adam,This is my least favorite superhero movie in recent memory&#46; I'm hoping &quot;The Rock&quot; will choose projects that truly challenge him as an actor and that go beyond cliche action set pieces and poor character development&#46;,NEGATIVE
Black Book,"Carice van Houten is a particularly strong lead, sucking the audience into her morbid world of perpetual torture and misfortune.",POSITIVE
Black Book,The film manages to turn German occupied Holland circa 1944 into a fast-paced thrill ride without sacrificing the emotional core and very real human toll.,POSITIVE
Black Book,"The handsomely mounted, heedlessly pulpy modernist World War II thriller that ""The Good German"" and ""Valkyrie"" failed to be - a dizzying rush of daring rescues, sexual intrigue, treachery, betrayal, gunfights, hasty conclusions and harrowing consequences.",POSITIVE
Black Book,"There are a lot of plot twists at the end of the film, maybe too many, but it will keep you guessing.",POSITIVE
Black Christmas,In its attempts to build a franchise and legacy&#44; Black Christmas stabs itself in the eye&#46; Blind from any sort of craft or talent&#44; every piece of the film fails in an overly exploitive and off-putting experience that is impossible to justify watching&#46;,NEGATIVE
Black Christmas,"The editing is horrendous. The tone is all over the place. The gore is over-the-top. It's a trashy mess. And yet, it's still dumb fun.",POSITIVE
Black Christmas,Certainly gory enough for fans of schlock horror.,NEGATIVE
Black Christmas,A rather useless remake. [Full review in Spanish],NEGATIVE
Black Hawk Down,&#8220;Black Hawk Down&#8221; is an intense&#44; visceral experience&#46; It's gritty action one minute and deeply moving the next&#46; But it never loses sight of its main focus &#8211; the soldiers&#46;,POSITIVE
Black Hawk Down,"Not nearly as potent as one might expect from this particular director, especially with a sizable budget and resources at his disposal, and governing this impressive cast.",POSITIVE
Black Hawk Down,"Scott pares back story, character development and moral righteousness to their bare essentials, resulting in the most striking, if not revealing, portrait of modern warfare ever filmed.",POSITIVE
Black Hawk Down,Violent depiction of a risky rescue; adults only.,POSITIVE
Black Knight,"If it doesn't sound funny, that's because it isn't.",NEGATIVE
Black Knight,Martin Lawrence amuses in raunchy comedy.,POSITIVE
Black Knight,"Black Knight is funnier than the ads made it look, but too indulgent and eager for its own good.",POSITIVE
Black Knight,"The first 23 minutes of Black Knight (yes, I timed it) are easily the most effective...",POSITIVE
Black Mass,Despite the seemingly eternal appeal of gangsters in cinema&#44; and Bulger as a subject of fascination and horror&#44; Black Mass proves to be little more than uninterestingly made based-on-a-true-story fare&#46;,NEGATIVE
Black Mass,Johnny Depp plays a monstrous Boston gangster in a disguise so unsettling you'll struggle to recognise him.,POSITIVE
Black Mass,Provides more than enough underworld intrigue to keep things interesting.,POSITIVE
Black Mass,"Though building upon favorable groundwork and populated with engaging performances, it loses much of its appeal by relating its shocking plot with an absence of panache.",NEGATIVE
Black Nativity,"If not for the presence of Oscar winner Forest Whitaker, Black Nativity would likely be an easily tossed away film for anyone.",POSITIVE
Black Nativity,"We're in that strange area where a film balances between two opposite ends: it's impossible to hate, but really tough to love",NEGATIVE
Black Nativity,"To wrap up, Black Nativity isn't the best holiday film we have this season and probably won't clean up at the cinema because in the end it's just a quite average movie.",NEGATIVE
Black Nativity,"Even though the principal (and poignant) message of forgiveness eventually wins through, the melodrama endured to get there is a high price to pay.",NEGATIVE
Black Panther,A heady mix of William Shakespeare and Walt Disney -- and with a few James Bond gadgets added to sweeten the deal -- it ventures far beyond wham-bam-thank-you-Stan territory&#46;,POSITIVE
Black Panther,&#91;The film's&#93; central struggle is one that you can see both sides of&#46; It's more of a idealogical conflict than a moral one&#44; which makes it so fascinating&#46; ,POSITIVE
Black Panther,Wakanda Forever is the big screen outing that has all the elements to give you a larger than life cinematic experience&#46; ,POSITIVE
Black Panther,But &#8220;Black Panther&#8221; isn it just a cultural statement&#46; It is a terrific film that energizes a genre as it has a community&#46; Not many movies can say that&#46;,POSITIVE
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,A disappointment&#44; especially compared to its excellent predecessor&#46;,NEGATIVE
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,lack Panther&#58; Wakanda Forever has the usual MCU mix of humour and fun action scenes but it's severely lacking a charismatic lead performer&#44; and some of the lazy writing during the final third was frankly embarrassing&#46; One of the weaker MCU efforts&#46;,POSITIVE
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,"Its pacing may feel a bit undercalculated as some scenes consume too much screen time, though unsure footing can be forgiven by closed chapters and new beginnings.",POSITIVE
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,The sheer volume of subplots makes the finished product rather unwieldy&#44; struggling to maintain the tight thematic focus of &#8216;Black Panther&#46; i,POSITIVE
Black Sea,Law is intensity carries the audience every step of the way&#46;,POSITIVE
Black Sea,Black Sea is a superbly crafted piece of film.,POSITIVE
Black Sea,"Despite plenty of brilliantly understated tension from realistic scenarios and excellent acting, the pacing routinely trudges.",POSITIVE
Black Sea,"While not breaking new ground cinematically, ultimately this is a good yarn, a tense two hour potential catharsis.",POSITIVE
Black Snake Moan,A nearly indefinable blend of pulpy guilty pleasures.,POSITIVE
Black Snake Moan,"Writer/director Craig Brewer has whipped up a controversy magnet that will make some fans of his first film, Hustle & Flow, retract anything they said in defense of its depiction of women.",NEGATIVE
Black Snake Moan,"Worth seeing for Sam Jackson alone, but one wonders what someone like Quentin Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez would have done with this material.",POSITIVE
Black Snake Moan,"Brewer uses these plot machinations to investigate ideas of race, religion and redemption in a way that for most of the film's running time is unusually riveting.",POSITIVE
Black Swan,A high-pitched affair that sometimes risks silliness and sometimes achieves it&#46; The risk is important &#8212; the movie is nothing if not impassioned &#8212; but overall the film is too rigidly schematic to be truly wild&#46;,POSITIVE
Black Swan,"Aronofsky wants you to feel that heroin oozing into your vein, he wants you to feel that barbed wire and glass burrowing under your tights, and here he wants you go right off the deep end with a girl in a tutu",POSITIVE
Black Swan,"While there are few films that with look and sound as good as this as 2011 plays out, there'll will be even less that will be so misunderstood. Black Swan is a hoot. A silly, melodramatic hoot.",POSITIVE
Black Swan,"Director Darren Aronofsky has done an excellent service by showing how art has reached the extreme of a downward demonic trend. Now that we've reached that extreme, perhaps, like the yin-yang symbol, things will turn around.",POSITIVE
Black Widow,Black Widow is both complex and engaging as its focus on familial relationships leads to some of the most memorable moments thanks to its ensemble and&#44; in turn&#44; creates new characters for Marvel is team to play with in their billion-dollar sandbox&#46;,POSITIVE
Black Widow,Natasha and Yelena are&#46;&#46;&#46; kicking &#42;ss&#44; getting dirty&#44; and ribbing on each other for posing while fighting&#46; But &#91;they're&#93; also compassionate enough to share a hug and cry&#46; To me&#44; this is the best female-led film in the superhero genre&#46;,POSITIVE
Black Widow,"Pugh is fabulous, by a long mile the best thing in the film, and for a few brief scenes it flares into life as that rare Marvel movie with no aspirations above street level. ",NEGATIVE
Black Widow,Harbour is Alexi stands out among this talented group,POSITIVE
Black and White,I never want to see this movie ever again. This is terrible. How dare we subject ourselves to this...,NEGATIVE
Black and White,This is absolutely wild. So problematic and a mess of epic proportions...,NEGATIVE

Black and White,"While Black and White is a little chaotic and overcrowded, it offers a relentless, honest look at race and power.",POSITIVE
Black or White,"Costner, however, hasn't been this good in years. He's a believable drunk with the look of a man who has weathered tragedy but hasn't given up.",POSITIVE
Black or White,"Too easy, breezy, and unabashedly middle of the road, Black or White doesn't truly grapple with contemporary issues of racism in America.",NEGATIVE
Black or White,"Wants to provide profound insight into racial relations and family, but the execution is heavy-handed.",NEGATIVE
Black or White,"Binder is handling some heavy material here, yet the direction constantly calls for comedic bits that undercut the gravity of each dramatic beat.",NEGATIVE
Blackhat,&quot;Blackhat&quot; is a movie built around a good idea and strengthened by some fantastic pulse-pounding action&#46; But ultimately it sinks due to its tiresome&#44; long-winded story&#46; Even the ever likable Chris Hemsworth can't help it&#46;,NEGATIVE
Blackhat,The film is best in its tangible moments between characters&#44; whether those moments involve realistic violence&#44; intimate romance&#44; or characters brooding in solemn singularity&#44; all of which are dependable tropes in Mann's engaging brand of cinema&#46;,POSITIVE
Blackhat,"Mann can stage a heart pounding action scene, and pulls off a couple of them here that spice things up when the movie starts to run a bit slow, but at 133 minutes the whole movie feels in need of a reboot.",NEGATIVE
Blackhat,Tiresome CG visualization of data transferring between computers twinkles repetitively and music swells while the camera focuses on button keystrokes and scrolling code.,NEGATIVE
Blade,"Blade is an entertainingly macabre and excitingly staged action horror, with a propulsive energy...",POSITIVE
Blade,"Stylized, smart and boasting a charismatic lead performance from Wesley Snipes, Blade belongs in the upper tier of comic book adaptations.",POSITIVE
Blade,"Blade is just good, plain action movie fun.",POSITIVE
Blade,Not only is this an important movie for comic book films in general -- it's just a f---ing blast!,POSITIVE
Blade II,"Basically, the sequel replays the original movie's set pieces with even more gore and less coherence.",NEGATIVE
Blade II,"Blade II is certainly not without interest... But mostly, it looks and feels so much like a video game that some members of the audience will feel their thumbs twitching before the final reel.",NEGATIVE
Blade II,"The original Blade movie was a chilling, gory vampire story, energetic and stylish -- all in all, a bloodthirsty success. The second one's chaotic and dumb and almost completely without thrills.",NEGATIVE
Blade II,"It's a fabulous-looking package, elegantly orchestrated by del Toro, who has an unerring eye for undead iconography, which he takes to visually imaginative extremes.",POSITIVE

Blade: Trinity,For series fans only. Definitely NOT for kids!,NEGATIVE
Blade: Trinity,"An action-packed mess from its lackluster, two-pronged opening segments to its final showdown.",NEGATIVE
Blended,Much of the humor is Sandler boilerplate stuff but a musical montage when Sandler realizes his daughter isn't just a tomboy anymore is funny and worth a look.,POSITIVE
Blended,Ignore the critics. Blended a return to form for Sandler.,POSITIVE
Blended,Blended could well be Coraci and Sandler's most abject collaboration to date.,NEGATIVE
Blended,"If you've seen the trailer, you've seen it all.",NEGATIVE

Bloody Sunday,Powerful retelling of 1972 demonstrations.,POSITIVE

Blow Dry,"In the end it may be nothing but hot air, but like a warming gust of conditioned wind after that cold morning shower, Blow Dry feels good (enough).",POSITIVE
Blow Dry,The half-hearted release mirrors the efforts put in by nearly everyone involved.,NEGATIVE
Blow Dry,The script by Simon Beaufoy of The Full Monty fame is far more soapy than bubbly as it concentrates on extended family entanglements and allows its comic potential to be bleached out by a ponderous mawkish streak.,NEGATIVE

Bobby,A relevant story done in by self-important speechifying and unfocused tangents.,NEGATIVE
Bobby,Estevez is no Robert Altman but he does do a good job in mixing in archive footage of Bobby Kennedy in with the fictional action. The saccharine tone is in keeping with the fawning perspective of this rambling love letter from Emilio to Bobby.,POSITIVE

Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius,Bobby Jones deserves a better movie than this one.,NEGATIVE

Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius,"Much like the many 'Jesus' movies, the film stays clear of controversy and plays it safe, making the casting of Jim Caviezel even more ironical.",NEGATIVE

Bon Voyage,"A nonstop, peripatetic, neo Hitchcockian farce...captures the chaos of a government in ruin.",POSITIVE
Bones,"Much better than its reputation would have you expect, Bones is a weird and impressive horror entry from Ernest Dickerson.",POSITIVE
Bones,BONES is both gloriously cheesy and gruesome in ways that will make your skin crawl.,POSITIVE
Bones,"Bones is basically A Nightmare on Crack Street, with Snoop Dogg playing a sleepier version of Freddy Krueger.",NEGATIVE
Bones,"The picture isn't particularly well-constructed, but Ernest Dickerson's direction is stylish and the performances are solid, making it very watchable - even though overall, Bones lacks many genuine thrills.",POSITIVE

Bram Stoker's Dracula,Here is a great filmmaker working at the height of his powers&#44; blending a specific auteur vision with the needs of a massive blockbuster &#40;the film grossed over &#36;300 million worldwide&#41;&#44; to develop a unique and hypnotizing experience&#46; Full review in Spanish,POSITIVE

Bratz,How did this film get a theatrical release?,NEGATIVE

Bratz,"It's derivative stuff, and played very straight despite its comical aspirations: this is Mean Girls without the irony.",NEGATIVE
Bratz,"How do our flighty young heroines fight back? By shopping, of course. There is no problem, it seems, a new tube top and mini-skirt can't fix.",NEGATIVE
Braveheart,"As he did with The Man Without a Face, Gibson takes his directorial chores so seriously that he squeezes the life out of the piece. ",NEGATIVE
Braveheart,"Braveheart is an astonishing spectacle of blood and heart, a virile and punishing epic, less interested in historical relevance than in grandiose myth-making. ",POSITIVE

Breach,Cooper works hard to provide any psychological subtext to the story behind the headlines.,POSITIVE

Breaking and Entering,"Insightful, contemporary love story for adults.",POSITIVE
Breaking and Entering,"A convoluted plot of break-ins, architectural redevelopment and mid-30s life crises mask a fairly standard tale of a love triangle.",POSITIVE

Brick Mansions,"It won't engage your brain, but is wild enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen.",POSITIVE
Brick Mansions,"Prioritizes the action, clearly unwilling to be bothered with constructing adequate character development or even a brief history on its subjects.",NEGATIVE
Brick Mansions,"It's about a cartoonish style of action fueled by fast-paced parkour, of which David Belle is considered one of the founders.",POSITIVE
Brick Mansions,"""Brick Mansions"" isn't a good movie, but it is fun, and that's enough. It's a bad movie that knows precisely what it is and what it needs to deliver in order to be successful, and it does just that.",NEGATIVE

Bridge of Spies,"It may not be a masterpiece, but it is a damn strong piece of cinema.",POSITIVE
Bridge to Terabithia,"An enchanting, suspenseful, masterful work which digs far deeper than most films of this genre before or since. It took chances where none were needed and all of these gambles paid off in spades. Watching it will make you a better human being.",POSITIVE
Bridge to Terabithia,Manages that rare feat of being both a faithful adaptation and appealing on an independent basis.,POSITIVE

Bright Young Things,The wit never comes through the art deco settings.,NEGATIVE
Bright Young Things,"If a movie can draw this kind of talent for mostly miniscule roles, how can you go wrong?",POSITIVE
Brightburn,"It may be a bit gory and filled with bad language for some, but if you are interested in a take on “evil teenage superman” I suggest giving Brightburn a try.",POSITIVE
Brightburn,A fun alternative take on the superhero genre&#46;,POSITIVE

Brotherhood of the Wolf,The reason to see this movie is the cinematography and the scenery and the composition of it.,POSITIVE

Bug,"Before it completely goes off the rails in its final 20 minutes, Bug generally comes off as a slow-moving yet exceedingly well-acted drama...",NEGATIVE

Dear Evan Hansen,Dear Evan Hansen&#46;&#46;&#46; I cannot forgive you for inflicting the worst movie musical since Cats upon us&#46;,NEGATIVE
Dear Evan Hansen,The film reeks of a group of people so in love with the original piece of work that they couldn't even see the flaws&#46;&#46;&#46; There may yet be a way to save this material&#44; this simply fine film version can't do it&#46;,NEGATIVE

Death of a Dynasty,"Sure, having bottles of Armadale vodka crammed into every other shot could be read as a pointed swipe at crass endorsements of luxury liquors. But when you know Armadale is owned by Roc-A-Fella, it looks a lot like crass product placement.",NEGATIVE
Death of a Dynasty,This narcissistic mockumentary is less a film than a full-length promotional video for Roc-a-Fella Records mogul/director Damon Dash.,NEGATIVE
Death of a Dynasty,"Definitely funny as the hip-hop world pokes fun at itself and others, but it's frequently pointless, especially as the ""plot"" unfolds.",NEGATIVE

Death to Smoochy,"Considering that it's meant to be a comedy about a TV children's show, DeVitto's picture is particularly irritating, nasty, and mean-spirited.",NEGATIVE
Death to Smoochy,"I giggled all the way through ""Death to Smoochy."" It wasn't that ha-ha giggle, it was that evil, kind of maniacal giggle.",POSITIVE
Death to Smoochy,Suffers from the same problem as most of the shows it pokes fun at - it runs on for far too long . . . to maintain a firm hold on the attention span of it's intended audience.,NEGATIVE
Deception,"The success of thrillers like this one depends heavily on skillfully handled smoke and mirrors, but Deception's predictable plot turns won't really deceive anyone.",NEGATIVE
Deception,"You know what's not sexy? Sexiness. I mean the overt, in-your-face, ""Aren't we all being sultry and naughty?"" sort of sexiness. Which is what this entire movie is, thinking it's daring.",NEGATIVE
Deception,You'd be hard pressed to find a sex thriller as unsexy and thrill-free as Deception.,NEGATIVE
Deception,The difference between a decent thriller and Deception is that a good thriller at least tries to keep you guessing with a few twists and turns.,NEGATIVE
Deep Blue Sea,Deep Blue Sea is overall a bit of a silly shark film&#44; but it is a really fun one with lots of action sequences&#46;,POSITIVE
Deep Blue Sea,"Despite the questionable fish visuals, several of the shark attack scenes are quite thrilling - utilizing suspense, comedy, nail-biting timing, and slimy animatronics.",NEGATIVE
Deep Blue Sea,"A gory, trashy blockbuster that succeeds despite its waterlogged script.",POSITIVE

Deep Water,This is fascinating stuff... that would be better served by a magazine article or book.,NEGATIVE
Deep Water,The film evokes a visceral understanding of solitude at sea.,POSITIVE
Deepwater Horizon,Berg is idea of social commentary is to shove the American flag into the frame at every opportunity&#46;,NEGATIVE

Deliver Us From Evil,Formulaic storytelling and glaring plot holes plague a film that tries to balance horror and cop procedural tropes into a half-hearted meditation on Christian faith&#46;,NEGATIVE
Deliver Us From Evil,"Combining things that go bump in the night with graphic gore, it's a brooding if not exactly riveting ride soundtracked by The Doors as the spirits try to 'Break On Through'.",POSITIVE
Deliver Us From Evil,The thing that really sinks the movie's momentum aren't the stock characters or lack of new thrills but the exposition scenes that explain the obvious.,NEGATIVE
Deliver Us From Evil,"It has some nice qualities and a pretty good climactic scene, but the use of well-known formulas and an uneven tone prevents it from being anything more than just ... what it is.",NEGATIVE
Demolition,"At times unpredictable and funny, Vallée's few inspired flourishes fall short of transcending the story's obviousness and sudden ending, despite a strong central performance by Jake Gyllenhaal.",NEGATIVE
Demolition,"The poetic dialogue, the dreamlike flashbacks, and the unfocused randomness (director Jean-Marc Vallee seems to be aiming for a modernized Godard) are always compelling.",POSITIVE
Demolition,"You may pull more out of it than I did. However, I can say that if you're looking for a really strong Jake Gyllenhaal performance and a few good laughs here and there, then give it a go.",POSITIVE
Demolition,"However strong the cast though, this is a meditation in common coming-of-age dramatic filmmaking which sadly doesn't quite hit home.",POSITIVE

Despicable Me 2,Kristen Wiig is an absolute wonder as Lucy.,POSITIVE
Despicable Me 3,"A constantly ka-chinging cash register disguised as a major motion picture, the utterly banal and utterly boring Despicable Me 3 is largely the animated equivalent of the current Transformers: The Last Knight.",NEGATIVE

Detroit,"The unfortunate aspect of 'Detroit' is the unconvincing shift in perspective that starts everywhere and narrows to here: this motel, this courtroom, these people, this event.",NEGATIVE
Detroit,A film about the 1967 race riots that feels sadly relevant.,POSITIVE
Detroit,"Detroit is a pulse-pounding, shocking, and poignant film, that becomes even more sad when you realize that after 50 years, we still have not come far from this fateful night in the motor city.",POSITIVE
Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo,"Like Bigalow's unfortunate clients, you'd do better to save your money for something classier.",NEGATIVE
Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo,"""Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo"" scrapes the bottom of the barrel and licks all around the sides.",NEGATIVE
Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo,This is gross-out without the gags (other than the stomach-churning variety),NEGATIVE
Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo,"It's 82 minutes of rampant misogyny and homophobia, peppered with occasional fits of toilet humor even the most obnoxious ten-year-old would find unfunny.",NEGATIVE
Devil,Perhaps the problem with M. Night Shyamalan is that he thought his talent was greater than what it was and believed his hokey stories could stretch to feature length.,NEGATIVE
Devil,It's difficult if not impossible to take any of it seriously.,NEGATIVE

Devil's Due,"Enduring the non-thrills of Devil's Due makes one thing clear: ""Found footage"" movies have passed their sell-by date.",NEGATIVE
Devil's Due,"Tiresomely and implausibly shot entirely as if found footage, this female-written horror is Rosemary's Baby for the Paranormal Activity generation.",NEGATIVE
Dheepan,"A fascinating film that never judges its characters, including the duller ones that are just the product of the space they exist in. [Full review in Spanish] ",POSITIVE

Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules,"Even though this new movie is under another director, it feels very much like the first film. The characters are great, being both relateable and extreme.",POSITIVE

Diary of the Dead,A sly but low-level zombie movie for the YouTube crowd.,NEGATIVE
Diary of the Dead,"It's rough around the edges, dirty in the middle, and stained through with a sort of nihilistic humanism that ultimately unsettles more than the lurching undead themselves.",POSITIVE
Diary of the Dead,Once again the master of the independent genre film manages to bring something fresh and worthy to the table.,POSITIVE
Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star,Not at all funny David Spade movie.,NEGATIVE
Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star,"Has nothing of value to offer other than a dizzying number of cameos by former child stars, each of whom is only momentarily amusing as a voyeuristic opportunity to compare the grown-up on screen to the kid ever emblazoned upon our mind's eye.",NEGATIVE
Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star,"A toothless, predictable showbiz comedy about the trials and tribulations of ... a has-been sitcom golden child who would do anything for a comeback.",NEGATIVE
Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star,A wince-inducing comedic atrocity.,NEGATIVE

Distant,It is very sad but also very beautiful&#46; &#40;Particularly after snow flocks the gray-on-gray city&#46;&#41; There is one breathtaking moment&#44; a scene involving a beached tanker in snow&#44; that is merely the best of dozens of indelible fragments&#46;,POSITIVE

Doctor Sleep,The movie has a hefty running time but it is in large part due to the story never taking shortcuts and offering up plenty of rich character details&#46;,POSITIVE

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,This had some really epic moments for Scarlet Witch &amp; brought up some real human consequence of being a hero&#44; BUT it also changed the dynamics for Olsen's Wanda since WandaVision &amp; left no foundation of whats coming for Marvel's multiverse saga as a whole,POSITIVE
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Marvel is insistence on world building synergy storytelling robs this latest strange tale of its identity&#46;,POSITIVE

Dogville,"A bold, beautiful work of art.",POSITIVE
Dogville,"These elements come together to form a movie that is clinically ironic but also unique, inspired, and quite sublime.",POSITIVE
Dogville,This minimalist&#44; digital-video-shot film has its own cinematic flash and thunder&#44; and does things only movies can do&#46;,POSITIVE
Dogville,An exceptionally literary film that at the same time employs extremely theatrical set design. Leave it to the mad genius of Denmark to kick cinema's ass once again.,POSITIVE

Dolphin Tale 2,"It's a good old-fashioned family film with animals you will adore, people you will enjoy, and a story that will make you feel better.",POSITIVE
Dolphin Tale 2,"""Dolphin Tale 2"" is fine when it stays in the pool, but there is way too much time spent away from the dolphin.",NEGATIVE
Dolphin Tale 2,"The dialogue is cheesy and some of the moments are contrived, yet overall it is still a safe, enjoyable film that kids especially can enjoy without Mom and Dad covering their eyes from random violence every few minutes.",NEGATIVE

Domino,"Despite a great deal of promise and a rousing (albeit too drawn out) finale, it is crippled by a lack of narrative focus and good characterization. But it could have been so much more, and that is truly the worst thing that could be said about it.",NEGATIVE
Domino,"...a tribute to Domino Harvey that reduces her to a nerve-jangling, romanticized song lyric.",NEGATIVE
Don't Breathe,"Not long after it's over, the previous 90 minutes go from being an impressive exercise in cinematic tension to little more than a technically sound production hanging by the thin threads of a plot-hole-ridden script.",NEGATIVE
Don't Breathe,"Surprisingly, this movie made me hold my grip for an hour so, and question my own gray areas. Sometimes horror does not need the supernatural. Full review in Spanish",POSITIVE
Don't Breathe,Dont Breathe is the ideal title for this film as not only its characters&#44; but the audience spends a part of the film holding their own breath rooting against the blind man and hoping the protagonists are able to escape&#46; ,POSITIVE

Don't Breathe 2,"The film lacks the relentless claustrophobic tension of its predecessor, leaving the gruesome takedown of the contemptible baddies as its defining feature.",NEGATIVE

Enchanted,Enchanted says it all.,POSITIVE

Escape Room,"The movie never involves the viewer in the puzzle or riddle-solving process. The characters rush from clue to clue, and we just watch as they figure it out. It's a passive experience.",NEGATIVE
Escape Room,"It's a shocking thing to witness a movie like this do just fine for so long, only to completely collapse right at the finish line.",NEGATIVE

Evan Almighty,"There's a great deal of comedic talent working here, and none of them can muster anything more than a decent chuckle.",NEGATIVE
Evelyn,"For every good decision the film makes, a few mushy, conspicuously crowd-pleasing, or manipulatively suspenseful narrative choices edge in on the entertainment value.",POSITIVE
Evelyn,"The first third of this film can seem like a downer, but the performances are absorbing and in no time at all it takes an inspirational, feel-good turn.",POSITIVE
Evelyn,Did director Bruce Beresford have to ratchet up the saccharine of an innately sentimental story?,NEGATIVE
Evelyn,...too schmaltzy to take seriously.,NEGATIVE
Everest,It isn it a brash&#44; bombastic popcorn flick&#46; It isn it a by-the-books &#8216;real events i movie&#46; Sure&#44; it has its big name ensemble cast and its share of visual &#8216;wow i moments&#46; But at the same time it felt small&#44; concise&#44; and restrained&#46;,POSITIVE

Every Secret Thing,"It is almost enough to make one forgive the film's flaws, including a melodramatic score that brings the piece uncomfortably close to afternoon TV movie territory at times.",POSITIVE
Every Secret Thing,An unpleasant crime drama.,POSITIVE
Every Secret Thing,"A ripped-from-the-headlines kind of story, it functions with all of the twists and turns required, a bit like a female-centered version of Prisoners.",POSITIVE
Every Secret Thing,Overly complex kidnapping drama has disturbing scenes.,NEGATIVE
Everybody Knows,One of Farhadi's major skills as a writer is to disguise his films' major themes within naturalistic dialogue&#44; so that what sounds like casual conversation soon reveals what Farhadi is really trying to say&#46;,POSITIVE
Everybody Knows,"The incredible suspense builds up and puts too much weight into the final act of the film, which ends up being somewhat disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]",POSITIVE
Everybody Knows,"Like the great Canadian short story writer Alice Munro, Asghar Farhadi forms intricate, mysterious narratives around a complex weave of characters, whose relation to one another takes you some time to sort out.",POSITIVE
Everybody Knows,"It can feel predestined at times, but Farhadi so earnestly downplays most canards, setting them off with fractal-like momentum.",POSITIVE
Everybody Wants Some!!,Outside of very brief dashes of existential reflection on team-building and proper courtship&#44; we simply watch these guys operate and clown around during an endless schedule of soirees for two hours&#44; and that easy breeze is just fine&#46;,POSITIVE
Everybody Wants Some!!,"Linklater's bittersweet Everybody Wants Some!! weighs all the possibilities and promises of the college years, while reminding his audience that frontiers are an illusion no matter your age.",POSITIVE

Everybody's Famous!,"Yes, I admit it, the film's corny, but there's nothing wrong with this can of sweet, imported niblets.",POSITIVE

Everybody's Famous!,"The movie ... was one of this year's Oscar nominees for best foreign film, leading one to wonder what films were passed over to make room for it.",NEGATIVE
Everything Everywhere All at Once,It holds within it a great idea&#44; when one disentangles it from the hairball that is the EEAAO narrative&#46; But &#91;&#46;&#46;&#46;&#93; in all its originality&#44; it telegraphs its message&#44; instead of allowing this intricately constructed ingenious world to be the message&#46;,NEGATIVE
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Much like a hallucinogen might cause you to cycle through every human emotion and see your life laid out end to end — theoretically — this film has an ability to dazzle built into every kinetic, colorful, madcap frame.",POSITIVE
Everything Everywhere All at Once,&#46;&#46;&#46; their Best Original Screenplay fuses science fiction&#44; action&#44; comedy&#44; and family drama all at once&#46; Genre jumping might be a better term to describe the Daniels i creative mode of filmmaking&#46;,POSITIVE

Ex Machina,Ex Machina&quot; has much more good than bad and much more surprise than contrivance when it comes to traversing the mine field that can be the science fiction topic of artificial intelligence&#44; especially with a potentially damning title like that&#46; ,POSITIVE
Ex Machina,By considering such ideas in an enclosed environment with so few characters&#44; Garland has made Ex Machina an intense&#44; engaging film that plays with the viewer's head and&#44; as the best films often do&#44; demands an exceptional degree of time to process&#46;,POSITIVE
Ex Machina,A fascinating sci-fi study of A.I. with incredible performances all around.,POSITIVE
Ex Machina,Alex Garland's directorial debut is an artificial intelligence film that asks the right questions...,POSITIVE

Exodus: Gods and Kings,How so many talented people came together here and just so completely whiffed on one of the most incredible stories ever written is beyond me.,NEGATIVE
Exodus: Gods and Kings,"Scott's film eschews all the Hollywood glam of DeMille's biblical epic. It's humanistic and so gritty you'll feel like taking a bath afterwards, but not in the Nile, which is turned a lurid blood red as one of the ten plagues.",NEGATIVE

Exorcist: The Beginning,One of the most pointless prequels of all-time.,NEGATIVE

Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,There have been very few films where so many fine performances added up to so very little cinematic satisfaction.,NEGATIVE

Eyes Wide Shut,A film detailing how unsexual sex is and how sexy almost having sex is&#46;,POSITIVE

Eyes Wide Shut,"Eyes Wide Shut (1999) is legendary director Stanley Kubrick's highly-anticipated, last completed film. It was titled 'Eyes Wide Shut' to imply self-contradictory opposites: at first being exposed or tempted, and then reflexively turning away...",POSITIVE
F9 The Fast Saga,"As a theatre-going experience, I can’t recommend F9: The Fast Saga enough.",POSITIVE
F9 The Fast Saga,F9 is one or two too many explosions and one or two too many quips away from achieving its goal of as an action flick with an intriguing plotline and stalls out as an overly self-aware stunt fest with a storyline you wish you had more time with&#46;,POSITIVE
F9 The Fast Saga,To be fair things like logic&#44; reality&#44; even physics simply don it apply to these movies&#46; You have to turn off a portion of your brain and let some obvious questions and concerns drift off into the ether&#46;,POSITIVE

Fallen,...an erratic yet rewarding thriller...,POSITIVE
Fallen,Director Gregory Hoblit consistently opts for an atmosphere of gloomy malaise rather than going for the cheap shocks.,POSITIVE

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them is an unexpected return to Rowlings wizarding world but with anything&#44; the unexpected surprises are sometimes the best&#46;,POSITIVE
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,...a predominantly worthless endeavor that seems to serve no purpose other than to lay the groundwork for future installments.,NEGATIVE

Freddy Got Fingered,"Freddy Got Fingered wants to shock you out of your middlebrow complacency, but it's never disturbing, only sad. That's not to say that Green didn't make exactly the film he wanted to make. It's just that Green is a pathetically one-note provocateur.",NEGATIVE

Gaia,On the whole&#44; Gaia is an invigorating effort&#59; combining body horror&#44; existential dread&#44; and ancient monsters into a singular genre cocktail&#46;,POSITIVE

Garden State,Smart drama for mature older teens and up.,POSITIVE
Garden State,"It's no longer a generational alarm clock, but for those who've seen loved ones stumble through complacent fogs of Paxil, Zoloft and the like, ""Garden State"" still warns that ""stability"" doesn't mean a numbness to anything not emotionally even-keeled.",POSITIVE
Garden State,"Actor Zach Braff (NBC's ""Scrubs"") makes an impressive if unsatisfying writing and directing debut with a plaintive post-modern drama that relies on unspoken dry wit to entertain its audience (think a cross between ""Harold and Maude"" and ""The Graduate"").",NEGATIVE

Gerry,"Gerry, in all ways, is a film geek film. Not for mass consumption, perhaps, but nonetheless a potent expression for those that like this sort of thing.",POSITIVE

Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,Sometimes you just want to watch a skeleton on fire beat the crap out of some people&#46;,POSITIVE
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,Cheesy CGI that is either intentional or just plain awful.,NEGATIVE

Girl With a Pearl Earring,"The movie benefits greatly from Johansson's gift for understated delivery, but she's less assured in this demure, largely non-verbal role than she was as a modern young woman in Ghost World and Lost in Translation.",POSITIVE
Girlfight,"Michelle Rodriguez, cutting a dazzling figure in her first acting role, plays Diana Guzman, a raw product of a broken family in the Brooklyn projects. Despair and anger find articulation in her sharpshooting fists.",POSITIVE
Girlfight,"As they say about boxing, it's the subtle blows that get to you most.",POSITIVE
Girlfight,Girlfight gets everything right: Its gritty bleak setting of a largely Hispanic Brooklyn neighborhood; the peeling walls and grimy atmosphere of the boxing gym... her bond with her sweet-natured brother and her combative relationship with her [father].,POSITIVE
Girlfight,"Kusama's talent as a filmmaker is obvious. Girlfight doesn't score a knockout, but it has moxy and some performances that guarantee that seeing it won't be a waste of time.",POSITIVE
Girls Trip,Moviegoers who endured a rough night watching the recent Rough Night will fare significantly better with Girls Trip.,POSITIVE
Girls Trip,"Expect start-to-finish hilarity, of both a sexual and scatological nature.",POSITIVE

Girls Trip,"If you need a good deep belly laugh, this is your movie.",POSITIVE
Girls Will Be Girls,Girls Will Be Girls is every bit as dull and offensive as it is frequently hysterical.,POSITIVE
Girls Will Be Girls,"An often hilarious, always surprising 79-minute burlesque.",POSITIVE
Girls Will Be Girls,"While Day doesn't succeed in making us empathize with anyone on screen, he makes his characters definitely watchable and his dialogue crackles.",POSITIVE
Girls Will Be Girls,A relentlessly mean picture that will tickle those tired of sweet comedies whether in drag or plainclothes.,POSITIVE
Gladiator,When the dust finally settled&#44; &#8220;Gladiator&#8221; pulled off a few minor miracles&#46; It catapulted Crowe into super-stardom&#44; removed any doubt that Scott could work within any particular genre with success&#44; and took a dusty old genre and made it new again&#46;,POSITIVE

Gladiator,"The film’s most important effect, if you will, is Crowe himself as the unabashed hero General Maximus, followed closely by Joaquin Phoenix as the Emperor Commodus. Gladiator is at heart their simple story. ",POSITIVE
Gladiator,"The new film has spectacular fight scenes in dazzling sets and a familiar story about honor and betrayal, courage and cowardice. It's the perfect vehicle for some old-fashioned sword-clanging fun. ",POSITIVE
Glass,&#8220;Glass&#8221; actually worked for me and I im anxious to see it again&#46; But it took some time to get there&#44; and I still find myself mulling over the final act&#46;,POSITIVE
Glass,This &#8220;accidental&#8221; trilogy is engaging&#44; suspenseful&#44; and the payoff is low-key rather than showy&#46;,POSITIVE
Glass,Glass is among Shyamalan's worst films&#44; and it's all the more disappointing because by association it spoils two of his best&#46;,NEGATIVE
Glass,As a matter of fact&#44; Glass should be a staple of how not to conclude a trilogy and how a films ending and unnecessary twist can change an entire opinion of not just a film&#44; but its predecessors&#46;,NEGATIVE

Glory Road,"If you're a basketball fan, you'll love it. If you're a parent looking for movie inspiration for your offspring, see it as a family outing. For everyone else, Glory Road is an accessible time capsule of American history.",POSITIVE
Glory Road,"Like most sports films Glory Road works best when it is actually showcasing its sport ... off the court, however, it's alternately flat and didactic. Director Gartner goes to great pains to drill the films message in, early and often.",NEGATIVE
Glory Road,"Glory Road doesn't have any of the individual moments that humanized Hoosiers, The Rookie, and Miracle. It's a feel-good sports movie by the numbers.",NEGATIVE
Glory Road,"Why must Hollywood lace every African-American drama with elements of comedy, as if black people find everything comical?",NEGATIVE
God's Not Dead 2,David A.R. White once again proves himself to be one of contemporary Christian cinema's most talented actors.,POSITIVE
God's Not Dead 2,"While the first God's Not Dead fed the persecution complex of evangelical Christians, God's Not Dead 2 takes that complex to Golden Corral.",NEGATIVE

Gods and Generals,Everybody is so good and decent that it's hard to tell where the generals leave off and the gods start.,NEGATIVE
Gods and Generals,"The big battles impress, but become somewhat samey. Part Three is threatened.",NEGATIVE
Godsend,Perhaps it's appropriate that a horror flick about cloning should be a derivative affair...,NEGATIVE
Godsend,A bad thriller that is too intense for tweens.,NEGATIVE
Godsend,"""Godsend"" suffers from a feeble plot, laughable dialogue, and thriller cliches that barely effect the characteristic jolts of the genre.",NEGATIVE
Godsend,Occasionally suspenseful but more often ludicrous.,NEGATIVE
Godzilla,Director Gareth Edwards constructs his film well which hearkens back to the fun sci-fi monster movies of the 1950s&#46; He uses their formulas of build up&#44; buildup&#44; slight reveal&#44; buildup&#44; big finale&#46; I loved that&#46;,POSITIVE
Godzilla,The last 30 minutes of Godzilla are so marvelously exciting that by this point&#44; the dull humans&#44; and the film's generally slow-build&#44; are secondary to the pure blockbuster showmanship anyway&#46;,POSITIVE
Godzilla,"Edwards and Borenstein structure Godzilla similar to early Steven Spielberg movies: open with a bang, hold back the monster until halfway through, and drive the story by using half-informed protagonists trying to solve the cover-up.",POSITIVE
Godzilla,"At least it's superior to 1998's hopeless Godzilla vs. Ferris Bueller, with the oversized monster no match for Matthew Broderick's shtick.",NEGATIVE
Godzilla 2000,"this is old-school Godzilla, meaning unconvincing special effects, a ridiculous plotline involving a rival monster, and lots of Japanese actors with badly overdubbed dialogue",POSITIVE
Godzilla 2000,Just nuthin' special,NEGATIVE
Godzilla 2000,I thought the original Godzilla was cheesy in 1954. So imagine how it feels to see the same degree of idiocy and only slightly improved special effects in a movie made 46 years later.,NEGATIVE
Godzilla 2000,"The problem with Godzilla 2000 is that, like wasabi, a little goes a long way. Thirty minutes would have been plenty for me.",NEGATIVE
Godzilla vs. Kong,"The showdown itself isn't disappointing and has in store a few ""surprises"" that in spite of being predictable are still enjoyable. [Full review in Spanish]",POSITIVE

Godzilla vs. Kong,It is 100&#37; geek food&#44; and I was more than happy to fill my plate&#46;,POSITIVE
Godzilla vs. Kong,"Leaning into its ludicrous nature was a smart move, delivering exactly what it says on the tin with just enough plot to keep you from looking at your phone.",POSITIVE
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,"I’m going to have to deduct some points for the score, sound, and script issues...",NEGATIVE
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,Michael Dougherty has delivered a Godzilla movie that is unquestionably action-heavy&#44; probably too much for those with no affection for the classic creature-features&#46;,POSITIVE
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,"Godzilla: King of the Monsters has done an effective job of making larger-than-life creatures completely inert, and any popcorn-munching fun that might've come from such a show has been reduced to a dismissive shrug. ",NEGATIVE
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,"...exceedingly, distractingly slick...",NEGATIVE
Going the Distance,"This easygoing, good-hearted, and spirited romantic comedy is a great end to Summer 2010.",POSITIVE
Going the Distance,"Very funny script, charming leads and memorable supporting characters.",POSITIVE
Going the Distance,"Unfortunately, Going the Distance doesn't take audiences far enough.",NEGATIVE

GoldenEye,GoldenEye tried to breathe new life into the franchise and it succeeded&#33;,POSITIVE
GoldenEye,"Directed by Martin Campbell, a newcomer to the genre, Goldeneye has as many special effects as any Bond film, and, for the most part, it delivers. It should be the real test as to whether a Bond audience still exists.",POSITIVE
GoldenEye,"The best bit of casting is Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp, who equates sex and death more than any other Bond character.",POSITIVE
Gone Girl,The visual presentation is moody and comfortless yet perfectly appropriate&#46; And the music from Fincher favorites Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor creates atmospheres of tension&#46;,POSITIVE
Gone Girl,More than the poetry of misdirection&#44; more than disappearances or curdling doubt&#44; more than sinister motives or cunning manipulation&#44; and more shocking than a singularly violent&#44; bloody death&#44; David Fincher's Gone Girl is a portrait of marriage&#46;,POSITIVE
Gone Girl,Employing crisp cinematography&#44; atmospheric sound design&#44; and an incredibly effective score&#44; Fincher manages to utilize many of these crafts to create an engaging premise that sells an intriguing thematic insight&#46;,POSITIVE
Gone Girl,Fincher combines a maze-like plot with brutal drama to create an unmissable thriller.,POSITIVE

Good Boy!,"Not particularly imaginative, but not the worst.",POSITIVE
Good Boy!,...perfectly suited for the small screen...,NEGATIVE
Good Boy!,"The ensuing wackiness will no doubt please children given to mooning over the family pet; it will lull their parents into a painless, agreeable stupor.",NEGATIVE
Good Boy!,"Like a flea-ridden old hound that hasn't learnt any new tricks and insists on slobbering over your shoelaces, it's curiously loveable all the same.",POSITIVE
Good Boys,The super sweet yet seriously sour antics of the Good Boys makes for one seriously gut-busting good time&#46;,POSITIVE
Good Boys,Good Boys is not a kids' movie but it's one of the funniest things all year...,POSITIVE
Good Boys,Not pretentious at all. The movie knows it's silly and sometimes even prepares entire scenes for the mere sake of a punch line. Had some fun watching it. Full review in Spanish,POSITIVE
Good Boys,"Here's a movie that should be watched at the end of a long day, preferably in a packed movie theater or with several friends to ensure infectious laughter.",POSITIVE
Good Kill,The material is intelligent and complex&#44; and the themes&#44; along with excellent performances from Hawke and Greenwood&#44; more than compensate for Niccol's frequent heavy-handedness in his drama&#46;,POSITIVE
Good Kill,"With more stereotypes than you can shake a joystick at, Good Kill reduces an important debate to a cliché-ridden mess. You'll die of boredom before it hits its target.",NEGATIVE
Good Kill,"Hawke, in particular, delivers a powerful and nuanced portrayal of a patriotic soldier who knows what he does is morally wrong yet realises it is to serve a greater good.",POSITIVE
Good Kill,"Like many a previous Niccol work, Good Kill is a human drama about a man hurled into a technological future no one could anticipate: a world in which we humans have come up with yet another ingenious way to torment ourselves.",POSITIVE

Good Luck Chuck,"Can I ""unwatch"" a movie? [Full review in Spanish].",NEGATIVE
Good Luck Chuck,"We've never gotten the appeal of Cook, and this did nothing to explain it.",NEGATIVE

Goosebumps,The film adaptation of R.L. Stine's classic horror novels is shockingly enjoyable.,POSITIVE
Goosebumps,"Will tickle your funny-bone more than raise any actual goosebumps, but it's a fun throwback to the kind of teenage thriller best enjoyed at a Saturday afternoon matinee movie with a large box of popcorn and a Coke.",POSITIVE
Goosebumps,"Better than you think it's going to be, but it also doesn't quite live up to the nostalgic glory.",POSITIVE
Goosebumps,Goosebumps is a movie you can watch with the kids and not be mad; you'll have a good time.,POSITIVE

Gosford Park,Not exactly a &quot;comedy&quot;&#44; even a dark one&#44; but suffused with a tart&#44; ironic wit&#46;,POSITIVE

Gosford Park,"Gosford Park expertly melds comedy and drama, eventually adding a pinch of intrigue with a second-act slaying.",POSITIVE
Gosford Park,"A riotously fun take on the murder mystery genre, and the finest of the director's late period works.",POSITIVE
Gossip,"Though it is reasonably effective as a morality tale on the dangers of spreading a rumor, it is even more pertinent to the perils of burying a worthy screenplay under layers of big-budget gloss.",NEGATIVE
Gossip,A taut second half in which the plot turns back on itself in some surprising twists makes up for the lethargic first half.,POSITIVE
Gossip,"Shallow Grave by way of Cruel Intentions, a breezy, entertaining mind-twister in which things spiral out of control for lots of good-looking kids and various alliances and narrative trap doors keep the audience enjoyably guessing as to who's",POSITIVE
Gossip,Insufferable (and interminable) in-joke of a roundelay.,NEGATIVE
Gothika,"There's nothing particularly original, gory or scary about Gothika - a really weak ""R"" rating - but it's more or less competent.",POSITIVE
Gothika,"The same story was told much more skillfully-and with a lot more scares-three years back, when it was called What Lies Beneath.",NEGATIVE
Gothika,"Grisly, disturbing, extremely violent horror film.",NEGATIVE
Gothika,"This shoddy B horror movie doesn't deserve a national theatrical run, much less the capable talent assigned to it.",NEGATIVE

Goya in Bordeaux,A visually pleasing but unmoving biopic of the 18th-century Spanish painter Francisco Goya.,NEGATIVE
Goya in Bordeaux,"Exquisite technique and deep passion come together so forcefully, so beautifully, as in the work of Spanish director Carlos Saura.",POSITIVE
Gracie,The reason these formulaic films work is they give sports fans what we want: a hard-working underdog we can root for and a sense that the sports we love have some deeper meaning.,POSITIVE
Gracie,Gritty girl soccer drama with a powerful message.,POSITIVE
Gracie,"A wholesome female empowerment adventure, and one very likely to resonate with youngsters of both sexes in the pre-teen crowd.",POSITIVE
Gracie,Ends up more like a middling after-school special than an insightful look at family dynamics.,NEGATIVE
Graduation,A remarkable film.,POSITIVE
Graduation,"An intelligent, elegant, morally ambiguous, and quite frankly brilliant tale of corruption and questioning whether it can ever be justified.",POSITIVE
Graduation,"Graduation resists easy resolutions or satisfying conclusions. It's a cinematic moral conundrum, raising numerous questions and answering very few of them.",POSITIVE
Graduation,"Mungiu knows Romania is in sore need of critiquing. The weird thing is, Graduation provides no excitement from such a critique.",NEGATIVE
Gravity,Gravity might still stand out as a technical achievement&#44; but viewing the film after the release of films like Interstellar and The Martian&#44; fails to stand out as super impressive or engaging overall&#46; ,POSITIVE

Gravity,For me the initial experience was unforgettable&#46; Completely original&#44; strikingly bold&#44; and brilliantly made&#46;,POSITIVE
Gravity,While its screenplay doesn't entirely take off&#44; its sound and visuals make this journey into outer space an unforgettable cinematic experience&#46;,POSITIVE
Gray Matters,Pretty quickly it disintegrates into a mishmash of character caricatures competing for airtime in which to spit out overly quirky dialogue in predictable set-ups.,NEGATIVE

Gray Matters,Forgettable coming-out comedy for older teens.,NEGATIVE
Gray Matters,...an amiable misfire.,NEGATIVE
Great Expectations,"The film has a defining contemporary hipness, and features good work by Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow. But it's more a meditation on its source than a filming of it. ",POSITIVE
Great Expectations,Where the film fails is in its commercial proclivity to centre the narrative trajectory around a fairly asinine updating of the Pip/Estella love-match into a soppy romance.,NEGATIVE
Great Expectations,"Visually stunning retelling has nudity, lots of swearing.",POSITIVE
Great Expectations,Cuarn and company end up throwing all the style they've got at the film... to compensate for a perpetually stalled drama.,NEGATIVE

Green Dragon,"Revisiting the painful aftermath of Vietnam from the perspective of American-bound refugees, Timothy's film is an honorable if not great companion piece to his brother Tony's Three Seasons; both films played at the Sundance Festival dramatic competition",POSITIVE
Green Dragon,"I've yet to find an actual Vietnam War combat movie actually produced by either the North or South Vietnamese, but at least now we've got something pretty damn close.",POSITIVE

Green Lantern,Overcoming a personal tragedy&#44; defeating various villains&#44; and discovering his powers with a trendy soundtrack to guide his way&#44; Reynolds i Hal Jordan is plain as can be&#44; even offensive in an age where this genre has elevated itself with dynamic films&#46;&#46;&#46;,NEGATIVE

Green Lantern,"The filmmakers are under the impression that audiences will accept anything, as long as it's drenched in special effects.",NEGATIVE
Green Lantern,Yet another film where the whole 3-D thing is a complete waste.,NEGATIVE
Gridiron Gang,"A typical, feel-good sports film with nearly every sports cliche' ever captured on film.",NEGATIVE
Gridiron Gang,"Gridiron Gang probably isn't a film that will appeal to non-sports fans, but it's just good enough to give football fans something to do before the next kickoff.",POSITIVE

Groundhog Day,"This delightful romantic comedy, directed by Harold Ramis, is rich in fantasy and unexpectedly funny twists.",POSITIVE
Groundhog Day,Groundhog Day is a Scrooge-like comedy that's surprisingly delightful. It poses a very interesting question: What would happen if every day were the same? ,POSITIVE
Groundhog Day,"There's a purity to Groundhog Day that we rarely see in movies... It's civilized, as well as the perfect entertainment of the moment. ",POSITIVE
Grudge Match,It is a film featuring some good performances&#44; scattered chuckles&#44; and pretty capable direction&#46; But you can dress up the pig all you want and it is still a pig&#46;,NEGATIVE

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,It entertains by finding an equilibrium between diversionary thrills and emotional substance.,POSITIVE
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"Like its predecessor, it stands on its own and might as well have 10 sequels without having to flirt with other Marvel movies. Paradoxically, despite being the funniest film in the MCU, it is, at the same time, the most emotional [Full review in Spanish]",POSITIVE
Guess Who,"One of the most terrible, unnecessary remakes of all-time.",NEGATIVE

Gulliver's Travels,"The pitch to remake this was probably four words: Gulliver's Travels Jack Black. No adjectives, no adverbs, and, most of all, no imagination. Fox took the bait, and this Christmas there's something smelling rotten under the tree.",NEGATIVE
Gulliver's Travels,"While the film retains the satire of the original story, it goes too far with the pop culture references.",NEGATIVE

Haiku Tunnel,There's just not enough of a story for this to be a feature film.,NEGATIVE
Haiku Tunnel,ultimately just a little too ingratiating.,POSITIVE
"Hail, Caesar!",&#8220;Hail&#44; Caesar&#33;&#8221; is very much an homage to classic moviemaking&#46; It's a wacky missing person caper&#46; It's a story of a man navigating personal and spiritual crises&#46; It's all of those things plus some&#46;,POSITIVE

Half Baked,"As far as pot comedies go, it's got just enough laughs to warrant a visit.",POSITIVE
Half Baked,The definitive stoner's anthem film. Chapelle is hilarious and charismatic. Great celebrity cameos help keep the uneven script afloat. (Best served fully baked).,POSITIVE
Hall Pass,If only &quot;Hall Pass&quot; were a TV pilot that kept the pace of Rick and Fred is first two days of freedom&#59; running eight minutes&#44; there would only be 20 left of what would likely be the only episode to air&#46; You will not provide your own laugh track&#46;,NEGATIVE

Hall Pass,"It is an unfortunate inclusion in an otherwise innocuous film, even if the formula expired more than 10 years ago.",NEGATIVE
Hall Pass,"Hall Pass teeters on the brink, and just about manages to stay in the rink.",NEGATIVE

Halloween,Zombie occasionally suffered from the Uwe Boll syndrome and felt a need to add pointless camera effects to dramatic scenes that only served to lessen the drama.,POSITIVE

Hanging Up,"A sappy, overly familiar enterprise.",NEGATIVE
Hanging Up,&#8220;Hanging Up&#8221; has plenty to say&#44; but gets bogged down with clich&#233;&#46; The most important thing to take from the film is that regardless of what success you may find in life&#44; you should never forget where you came from,NEGATIVE

"Happy, Happy",Good-natured Norwegian culture-clash comedy between city folks and their new small-town neighbours.,POSITIVE

Harrison's Flowers,"When describing an Andie MacDowell movie, the words ""gritty"" and ""harrowing"" do not immediately spring to mind.",POSITIVE

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,It is without a doubt the best made film of the series.,POSITIVE
Harsh Times,"A crazy little film, modest in its scope but grand in its ambition. It paints it's story in loud primary colors, with intense pressure cooker characterizations.",POSITIVE

Head in the Clouds,This soapy saga is for adults only.,NEGATIVE
Head in the Clouds,"Even as a potboiler, this melodrama is too silly and improbable to be enjoyed as trash",NEGATIVE

Head of State,Chris Rock runs for president.,POSITIVE
Head of State,"'...Along comes Chris Rock with ""Head of State"", a mild comedy...'",NEGATIVE
Head of State,"Although a reheated formula, Head of State dishes out a few original laughs due to in part to the writing of Chris Rock.",NEGATIVE
Heartbreakers,An absolutely deplorable wretch&#44; this is Gene Hackman at his most wildly unhinged&#44; a scene-stealing turn that chews just enough scenery to ignite laughing fits whenever he is around while never attempting to upstage the film is stars&#46;,POSITIVE
Heartbreakers,"...a better genre film that Ocean's 8, and shows that Weaver really has what it takes to hold a comedy together...",POSITIVE
Heartbreakers,There's little doubt that Heartbreakers is at its best during its breezy and completely entertaining first half...,POSITIVE
Heartbreakers,"This may be a screwball comedy, but it also has a heart.",POSITIVE
Hearts in Atlantis,Above average coming of age story.,POSITIVE
Hearts in Atlantis,A movie that says we might as well pack it in as soon as we turn 18 is more bitter than bittersweet&#46;,NEGATIVE
Hearts in Atlantis,"What happened to the prodigious vitality of Scott Hicks (Shine): His third feature sugffers from the same stifling artistic treatment that his second did, and this one is based on stories by Stephen King!",NEGATIVE
Hearts in Atlantis,Hearts in Atlantis is a leap of faith with nothing on the other side.,NEGATIVE

Heaven,"Casts a poetic, otherworldly romantic spell.",POSITIVE
Heaven,The story itself holds a sense of stark reality and raw emotions mixed with a sense of flight and fantasy.,POSITIVE
Heaven,"while Franka Potente fans may keenly feel her absence in this film, the addition of the absolutely phenomenal Cate Blanchett more than balances the books.",POSITIVE

Heaven Is for Real,Highly recommended for those struggling with belief in spiritual realities.,POSITIVE
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"A deeply rich, incredibly authentic musical.",POSITIVE
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,Mitchell's performance and Stephen Trask's incredibly touching tracks allow for delirious cinematic spectacle. Mitchell's Hedwig... remains one of cinema's most heartbroken and heartbreaking cinematic chanteuses.,POSITIVE
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,The film hums with the plasticine kineticism of Terry Gilliam as the camera tilts and moves with all the abandon of one of Hedwig's shows.,POSITIVE
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,Brazenly breaks down the holy silos of the masculine and the feminine gender binary and revels in the ambiguity between.,POSITIVE
Heist,&#46;&#46;&#46;Heist benefits substantially from a narrative bursting with surprising twists and plot developments&#46;&#46;&#46;,POSITIVE
Heist,A cold-blooded neo-noir thriller as only Mamet could make them&#46;,POSITIVE
Heist,When so few heist movies occupy but cannot overcome the subgenre is blueprint&#44; Mamet is Heist remains as singular as its title&#46;,POSITIVE

Hell Baby,"It's far from a consistent film, but Hell Baby could be an ideal way to get a few laughs while trying to kill time.",NEGATIVE
Hell Baby,"In short, all that remains is a diaper rash of an awkward horror-comedy that has pooped on its own meager pranks.",NEGATIVE
Hell Baby,"While not a lot of Hell Baby works... the movie does seem destined to be the sort of acquired-taste howler that will most likely attract people who recognize how ridiculous horror movies can be-and, of course, stoners.",NEGATIVE
Hell Baby,"A slog through improv run amok -- a film that seems allergic toward anything that might be construed as a legitimate throughline, lest that somehow be interpreted as 'selling out,' and not subversive enough.",NEGATIVE
Hell Ride,"A messy homage that borrows (or steals) heavily in its visuals, music, camerawork, and timeline-hopping storytelling.",NEGATIVE
Hell Ride,"Bikers, babes, blood, booze ... and blah.",NEGATIVE
Hell Ride,Hell Ride is a smoldering yet completely dull wreck of a movie.,NEGATIVE
Hell Ride,"The dialog is clever, nutty and syncopated, with a soundtrack -- of the ""C.C. Rider"" vein -- which ain't half-bad, either.",NEGATIVE
Hellboy,The needless reboot of Hellboy sheds light on a union between director Neil Marshall and Lionsgate that practically screamed perfect match&#44; but is in need of an annulment&#46;,NEGATIVE
Hellboy,"It's not merely that del Toro made two visually inspired, technically rich, and surprisingly touching superhero movies, it's that Marshall has made an aggravatingly terrible version of the same material.",NEGATIVE
Hellboy,"Hellboy is a poor adaptation, but most importantly it is a poor use of all the talents involved.",NEGATIVE
Hellboy,This hellfire has already been extinguished.,NEGATIVE
Hellboy II: The Golden Army,"Full of imaginative creatures and settings, Del Toro lets loose on this fun sequel that improves what came before. Ron Perlman is perfect as the cocky hero with a heart. [Full review in Spanish}",POSITIVE
Hellboy II: The Golden Army,"There's still too much posing for the camera, but the introduction of dozens of new fantastical deviations drowns out the typical overdose of heroic photo stances.",POSITIVE
Hellboy II: The Golden Army,The rarest of sequels that is actually better than its predecessor.,POSITIVE
Hellboy II: The Golden Army,"The film is full of fascinating creatures and a mythical world unlike any seen on screen since, well, del Toro's last film, Pan's Labyrinth.",POSITIVE
Here Comes the Boom,I have no qualms about saying that anyone who appreciates Kevin James will unquestionably appreciate Here Comes the Boom.,POSITIVE
Here Comes the Boom,"The way James, Rutten, and Winkler connect is engaging and amusing, and Here Comes the Boom is moderately successful on that chemistry alone. And if something can crack my cold, cold heart, that's a victory.",POSITIVE
Here Comes the Boom,"In this tacky ""Stand And Deliver"" meets ""Rocky"" hybrid, logic isn't even a word, let alone a concern of the filmmakers.",NEGATIVE
Here Comes the Boom,"A lightweight action-comedy that only tries to entertain, but at least it meets that modest goal. And it knocks out lighter weight comedies like The School of Rock.",POSITIVE
Hereditary,Fine performances&#44; a strong directorial debut&#44; and soaked in the strategically menacing score by Colin Stetson&#44; &#8220;Hereditary&#8221; slowly pulls you in before giving your nerves and your senses a good working over&#46;,POSITIVE

Hey Arnold! The Movie,...This film really has no business in theatres.,NEGATIVE
Hey Arnold! The Movie,Arnold's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces.,NEGATIVE
Hidalgo,"Although some of the colonial stylization is impressive, this Mortensen post-""Rings"" vehicle is pure horse neck and camel meat.",NEGATIVE
Hidalgo,...the film's hold on the viewer dwindles steadily as it enters its progressively dull midsection...,NEGATIVE
Hidalgo,"If you take it as historical fact, it's got a world of problems. But if you're just in the mood to be entertained, it can be a decent piece of Saturday afternoon escapism.",POSITIVE
Hidalgo,"Formulaic, overly simple, too violent for tweens.",POSITIVE
Hidden Figures,&#8220;Hidden Figures&#8221; is a polished Hollywood movie through and through&#44; but the power and importance of its story along with the three central performances easily overshadow any hiccups&#46;,POSITIVE
Hidden Figures,The right crowd-pleaser for the right time.,POSITIVE

Hidden Figures,"The film never relinquishes its tight focus on three remarkable individuals who repeatedly demonstrate that they, too, possess the right stuff.",POSITIVE
Hide and Seek,Older teens may enjoy; too creepy for kids.,POSITIVE
Hide and Seek,"Shameless in its appropriation of incidents and atmosphere from earlier horror movies, with De Niro giving one of the emptier performances of his latter-day career.",NEGATIVE
Hide and Seek,"The best way to tell when things are getting bleak is to check Dakota Fanning's face. When she starts to look like a poached egg, that's when you better hide.",NEGATIVE
Hide and Seek,"The 'surprise' ending in Hide and Seek is not only unreasonable, but also downright unoriginal.",NEGATIVE
High Crimes,Mediocre thriller of the betrayed-woman genre.,NEGATIVE
High Crimes,"Hampered by a bad script, this is a middling political thriler that's not supsenseful or dramatic enough to generate any interest in the proceedings; the good Morgan Freeman is totally wasted.",NEGATIVE
High Crimes,This is the work of a director who seems to have been as bored and uninspired making this movie as I was watching it.,NEGATIVE
High Crimes,High Crimes has its fair share of decent courtroom scenes but the legal tussles are far better than the emotional ones.,NEGATIVE

High Fidelity,"It's not perfect, but boy, is it ever accurate and insightful.",POSITIVE
High Fidelity,"High Fidelity, with its knowing take on men, messed-up romance and music, is like one long, hook-filled pop song for the eyes.",POSITIVE
High Fidelity,As a film about males it`s amazingly insightful for women. The soundtrack`s another great plus. I just adored this film.,POSITIVE
High Heels and Low Lifes,You can't help feel that the director settled for smirks when he could've had bellylaughs.,NEGATIVE
High Heels and Low Lifes,Won't leave audiences with too many bad memories--mostly because it evaporates from memory as soon as the closing crawl begins.,NEGATIVE
High Heels and Low Lifes,"Driver and McCormack make appealing heroines, and Kevin McNally and Michael Gambon are gratifyingly menacing villains.",POSITIVE
High Heels and Low Lifes,"Like the designer suits Driver wears despite her character's meager earnings, High Heels and Low Lifes isn't about reality; it's playing dress- up.",NEGATIVE
High-Rise,"The experience cannot be described as enjoyable; however, many may come to appreciate the anarchy's commentary with distant admiration.",POSITIVE
High-Rise,Has no room for subtlety. But it has plenty of style and substance.,POSITIVE
High-Rise,The film's message is timely but simple...,POSITIVE
High-Rise,"Uncompromising and disjointed, it's unapologetically weird; a film that seems likely to earn instant cult status.",POSITIVE

Hit and Runway,Sympathetic performances by the leads and surprisingly convincing sentimentality.,POSITIVE
Hit and Runway,Has an endearing charm despite the fact that it just screams 'my first feature.',POSITIVE
Hitch,"In the 17 years since (and the 10 or so before) the release of Hitch, websites and apps, which were geared to those looking for love or something like it, make what takes place throughout this film appear quaint, arcane, and more than a bit dated.",POSITIVE
Hitch,"It's witty, full of romantic wisdom and makes up for in laughs what it lacks in substance.",POSITIVE
Hitch,"Will Smith's first-ever rom-com. Needless to say, the versatile star was up to the job at the first time of asking.",POSITIVE
Hitch,Will Smith charms again; best for teens and up.,POSITIVE
Hitchcock,The acting is top-notch all around&#44; but Gervasi is treatment makes one want to pick up a Hitchcock biography instead&#46;,NEGATIVE
Hitchcock,"Most closely resembling a romantic comedy, the film's tone keeps the proceedings consistently entertaining, but also prevents intrusion of any serious drama.",POSITIVE

Hitchcock,Hitchcock may have right intentions in mind but not the best execution.,NEGATIVE
Hitman,Underwhelming Eurotrash trashy video game film.,NEGATIVE
Hitman,"The creators have gone to great lengths to showcase the blood, bullets, and babes requisite for a proper translation of the popular assassin adventure.",POSITIVE

Holes,This Burtonesque slice of Southern whimsy works much better on the page than it does on screen where its events transpire arbitrarily and seem less organic.,NEGATIVE

Hollow Man,"The ""invisible man"" idea isn't new, but the graphic nature of this film is certainly a deviously curious twist.",NEGATIVE

House of Gucci,[Ridley] Scott resorts to a format closer to a soap opera by using and abusing a series of gimmicks... [Full review in Spanish],NEGATIVE
House of Gucci,Much like Leto is performance&#44; House of Gucci is likely to polarise audiences&#46; It is glamourous and gaudy but also tedious and tiresome and&#44; for what is supposed to be a compelling crime story&#44; the result is a confusing mess&#46;,NEGATIVE
House of Gucci,With any other cast&#44; House of Gucci would have been a subpar movie&#44; floundering through the ripped-from-the-headlines intrigue of a murder-for-hire&#44; but with this cast&#44; Ridley Scott has created a wickedly fun romp&#46; ,POSITIVE

House of Wax,Holding the movie up to a flame shows it can't hold a candle to its predecessor.,NEGATIVE
House of Wax,"Although it's filled with stupid characters who make basic horror movie mistakes (they take the detour, accept a ride from a stranger, investigate the creepy town, etc.), it also has a way of getting under the skin. ",POSITIVE
House of Wax,"Collet-Serra delivers a pleasingly ruthless nightmare that does especially well with creepy visuals and bodily harm, resulting in one of the best Dark Castle Entertainment offerings.",POSITIVE

Hulk,"Even if Lee would have wanted to rise above the simple two-dimensional universe of the comic books, his portrayal remains just as flat.",NEGATIVE

I Love You Phillip Morris,"A comedy that's all the funnier for the laughs carrying weight, a drama that's all the slicker for having a lighter side, a bit of a mess but a really fun mess...",POSITIVE

I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry,Nobody would have guessed that the refined Alexander Payne would sign on this kind of homophobic comedy full of stereotypes. [Full review in Spanish],NEGATIVE
I Spy,"There's nothing groundbreaking, nothing important, nothing socially conscious here. It's just two very funny guys, a plot that makes no sense at all - and a whole lot of laughs.",POSITIVE
I Spy,The black guy-white guy buddy movie is totally spy by-the-numbers.,NEGATIVE
I Spy,TV classic remade as a forgettable buddy movie.,NEGATIVE
I Spy,"Serves up the expected gags and set pieces in service of a thoroughly been-there, done-that plot line.",NEGATIVE

I Think I Love My Wife,Rock's so-so temptation comedy earns its R rating.,NEGATIVE

I'll Sleep When I'm Dead,"If anything, there a little too much dramatic action to be fully explored here. But if that makes for a slightly unsatisfying end result, it's no great criticism of an otherwise mature, sleazy piece of British film noir.",POSITIVE
I'll Sleep When I'm Dead,"While the performances are excellent and the Get Carter-in-reverse plot is intriguing, this is a film where atmospherics triumph over the script.",NEGATIVE

"I, Daniel Blake","Righteous commentary on the state of the UK, which hits home with the force of a sledgehammer...",POSITIVE
"I, Daniel Blake","Loach, at 80 years old, has returned to the brief social drama for which his cinema has been characterized. It offers us a moving and very human film that functions as the voice of the British people who demand to be heard. [Full review in Spanish]",POSITIVE
"I, Frankenstein",Regardless of how much I might enjoy goofy&#44; cheesy material especially in the horror genre&#44; at some point you have to offer more&#46;,NEGATIVE
"I, Frankenstein","There is some cool gothic Gargoyle imagery on display and a variety of posh English accents to class to the joint, but it seems only Nighy realizes that this would have played better as a campy comedy.",NEGATIVE
"I, Frankenstein","Not the worst movie ever made, but far, far removed from the best.",NEGATIVE
"I, Frankenstein","I, Frankenstein's finale predictably leaves it open for a sequel, the thought of which would likely have the Baron and his creation spinning in their graves.",NEGATIVE
"I, Robot","The way in which the robots acrobatically leap about, as if immune to the effects of gravity, is the main offender.",POSITIVE
"I, Robot","Some stirring action sequences and a fascinating futuristic setting keeps things entertaining, even if this loose adaptation of the Isaac Asimov doesn't always take the most original approach possible.",POSITIVE

"I, Tonya",Margot Robbie and director Craig Gillespie do the impossible&#58; they turn Tonya Harding&#44; 1994's most vilified American&#44; into a sympathetic figure&#46;  My &#35;2 movie of 2017&#46;,POSITIVE
"I, Tonya","The result is one part Tonya's personal truth of the events, one part reveling in junk food news, and another part media critique. Still, the joys of this film should not be understated.",POSITIVE

"I, Tonya","I, Tonya adopts the right tone to relate the factual tale of the whacked kneecap, spinning it in a darkly comedic direction.",POSITIVE
Ice Age,"Innovative illustration, sharp scripting and vibrant vocalising gives this sprightly animated comedy a knack for melting down the frostiest resistance.",POSITIVE

Ice Age: The Meltdown,I never bought in to this film and found myself regularly distracted by animation that seemed bland and boring.,NEGATIVE
Ice Age: The Meltdown,"Vaguely entertaining sequel to the big animated hit of 2002, but a bit flat...",NEGATIVE
Ice Age: The Meltdown,"As with the first ""Ice Age"" movie it is Scrat the acorn-obsessed rodent who bookends the movie and steals the most laughs with his hilarious attempts at obtaining an ever-elusive acorn.",POSITIVE

Identity Thief,"Despite it's formulas and occasionally stale moments, I found myself surrendered to the entire journey and enjoying myself immensely.",POSITIVE
Identity Thief,dentity Thief is awash with a hackneyed and horribly mawkish type of moralising. It's as if studios have voluntarily adopted a new skewed iteration of the Hays Production Code for its comedies.,NEGATIVE
Identity Thief,s there a heart-wrenching back story to explain why Diana is the way she is? Yes. Did I laugh? Yes.,POSITIVE
Idiocracy,Crappy film.,NEGATIVE
Idiocracy,"While dumb people are an easy target, Judge makes a mistake in only working variants of this one riff.",NEGATIVE
Idiocracy,"Although Wilson's everyman is a bit too much of a blank slate to really care about, the gaudy visuals and cynical gags more than compensate.",POSITIVE
Idiocracy,The film is completely unique and its sci-fi bent is fully realized in a way that some sci-fi films fail to capture.,POSITIVE
If I Stay,Grace Moretz is miscast in this drama that sidelines all of its secondary characters to focus on a romance that lacks any chemistry and director Cutler's lack of visual imagination is disappointing&#46; Maybe the best YA parents since Easy A&#44; though&#33;,NEGATIVE
If I Stay,"It's a study of life and loss, leaning heavily on the regret of building relationships only to see them disappear in the wink of an eye. Luckily Moretz's subtle performance prevents the movie from becoming a soap opera of despair.",POSITIVE
If I Stay,"No matter how hard it tries, it just won't make you cry.",NEGATIVE
If I Stay,The film gets by on the quality of its cast and the predictable yet fundamentally warm nature of its material.,NEGATIVE
Ignorant Fairies,"Ozpetek offers an AIDS subtext, skims over the realities of gay sex, and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight, middle class bores like Antonia can feel good about themselves.",NEGATIVE
Ignorant Fairies,"It's a soapy, simplistic, but surprisingly affecting ambisexual melodrama that plays a little like Pedro Almodovar without the surreal frills.",POSITIVE
Ignorant Fairies,At once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance.,NEGATIVE

Illusion,There's a sincerity to the filmmaking here that's at times quite touching: Illusion presents a portrait of true love that's as picture perfect as the sunny spring garden in which we see Isabelle.,POSITIVE
Illusion,"Several of its transitions are glaringly contrived, and its morality tale never quite comes together to be the shattering spiritual experience it wants to be.",NEGATIVE
Imaginary Heroes,"The fractured, non-linear narrative fires plenty of red herrings and there are plenty of pointless characters with melodramatic side plots that go nowhere.",NEGATIVE
Imaginary Heroes,"Sigourney Weaver is impeccable as a distraught mother who resorts to pot to barricade her emotions in writer/director Dan Harris' diamond-sharp treatise on American family dysfunction that makes ""The Ice Storm"" look like a walk in the park.",POSITIVE

Imaginary Heroes,"Especially forceful performances make it well worth watching, even if it becomes a bit too much at times.",POSITIVE

Immortals,"While this may be one instance where Singh's art outweighs his story, it sure does look good doing it and I enjoyed almost every minute of it.",POSITIVE

Immortals,"Find the biggest screen, crank the stereo up loud, and revel.",POSITIVE
In America,Should be talked about more as one of the great American movies. Incredible,POSITIVE
In America,Moving but slightly graphic; mature teens only.,POSITIVE

In the Bedroom,...A whole greater than the sum of its parts.,POSITIVE

In the Land of Women,Touching-but-treacly chick flick for moms & teens.,POSITIVE
In the Land of Women,Jonathan Kasdan infects them with a smart-ass self-awareness and a grandiose sense of vitality that borders on preciousness. It has that Baby Boomer quality of his father's films without any of the history to back it up.,NEGATIVE

Inferno,"The arrival of Inferno, Howard's treatment of the fourth novel in Brown's series, feels marked by the underwhelming previous efforts and a decided sense of obligation toward maintaining an unwanted franchise.",NEGATIVE

Intolerable Cruelty,"These stars not only light up the screen, they generate enough electricity to light up Times Square. Movies just don't get better.",POSITIVE
Introducing the Dwights,"Small-minded, ambitionless, soap-opera dreck, sure to make moviegoers wish that they were never introduced to the Dwights.",NEGATIVE
Introducing the Dwights,Uneven dysfunctional family dramedy for adults.,POSITIVE
Introducing the Dwights,A movie that works beautifully when it's on point and feels sort of hollow when it's not.,NEGATIVE
Introducing the Dwights,"Yes, Introducing the Dwights is a melodrama, but this melodrama handles its emotional manipulation with such subtle honesty that it takes on an impressive degree of realism.",POSITIVE
Invictus,"It's all quite draining, with one enthusiastic hurrah after another, until there couldn't possibly be any more motivational orations.",NEGATIVE
Invictus,It is a film that will likely entertain both history buffs and fans of sports films.,POSITIVE
Invictus,Freeman was born to play his friend Mandela in Eastwood's inspiring movie.,POSITIVE
Invictus,"There's plenty here to keep the interest for most, and the performances, particularly Freeman's, are excellent.",POSITIVE
Invincible,"By the time Papale does make it the big game, it's as if the air goes out of the movie and all Core can do is punt.",NEGATIVE
Invincible,"Edifies Herzog's preoccupation with blurring the distinction between performance and naturalism, fiction and documentary.",POSITIVE
Invincible,A unique visual work.,POSITIVE
Invincible,"...the naivete of his performance has a humbling effect on a film that, while entirely too long and short on sizzling imagery, is meant to be taken simply as folkloric.",POSITIVE
Iris,"This in an informative, well-acted biopic of a woman whose life's work deserves to be preserved and remembered.",POSITIVE
Iris,"Admittedly, it's hard not to be affected.",POSITIVE
Iris,"Despite good acting from the two pairs, viewers expecting illuminating insights about the literary genius, eccentric philosophy and complex sexuality of Iris Murdoch will be disappointed by Richard Eyre's minor, rambling, TV-like film.",POSITIVE
Iris,"...Iris isn't necessarily an enjoyable piece of work, though it's certainly interesting...",POSITIVE
Iron Man,An exceptionally well-made debut for Marvel Studios&#46; Fun&#44; engaging and bolstered by a tour-de-force lead turn by Robert Downey Jr&#46;,POSITIVE
Iron Man,A fun two-hours thanks to a top cast lead by a charismatic Robert Downey Jr. Most of the effects still hold up and the action scenes are still exciting.,POSITIVE
Iron Man,"If you don't like Iron Man, then you should stop going to movies.",POSITIVE
Iron Man,"This is Downey at the top of his game, delivering a performance full of humor and self-awareness.",POSITIVE
Iron Monkey,"As a perfect complement to the adventure, a generous portion of comedy is blended in - sometimes just with witty bits of dialogue and frequently with physical slapstick.",POSITIVE
Iron Monkey,"Where Iron Monkey really comes alive is with the action, and here's where the audiences who enjoyed Crouching Tiger are repaid ten-fold.",POSITIVE
Iron Monkey,"some of the finest martial arts displays imaginable, and it doesn't take itself seriously",POSITIVE
Iron Monkey,"Despite it's tonal split personality, Iron Monkey is a fun Hong Kong martial arts action-comedy that offers a heck of a climax.",POSITIVE
Isle of Dogs,The huge and talented cast offer up superb voice work&#44; and they all meld seamlessly into Anderson is handsomely idiosyncratic world&#46;,POSITIVE
Isle of Dogs,"It's perhaps too easy for the viewer to become lost in Anderson's creativity, as opposed to becoming lost in the emotional power of the storytelling, and so Isle of Dogs feels less engaging than his previous output.",POSITIVE
Isle of Dogs,"Isle of Dogs is a perfect film for dog lovers, or maybe just animal lovers in general. It expresses the special bond and friendship between humans and their pets. Wes Anderson realizes these ideas with an amazing, unique flare.",POSITIVE
Isle of Dogs,"Meticulously crafted, well-acted and often hilarious.",POSITIVE
It,The film is just as much an evocation of troubled adolescence as it is a horror romp featuring a malevolent clown&#46;,POSITIVE
It,"When the scary things emerge from the dark and turn out to be digital specters, it's not all that terrifying. More effective is our investment in the characters and their fates.",POSITIVE
It,It like Pennywise is a being of its own - a blend of The Goonies and A Nightmare on Elm Street&#46; ,POSITIVE
It,"The production, the performances, the visuals, the story, the horror, and everything else gels together into one of the best Stephen King movies ever made.",POSITIVE
It's Kind of a Funny Story,"Features an exceptional cast, a sensible blend of dark humor with dramatic overtones, and the inclusion of several creative fantasy sequences.",POSITIVE
It's Kind of a Funny Story,"Galifianakis proves himself as an actor here, and Gilchrist and Roberts will surely be going places. It is a feel-good movie despite the subject matter.",POSITIVE
It's Kind of a Funny Story,"An uneven film, and its earnestness is a bit stretched, but its characters are mostly oddly endearing.",NEGATIVE
It's Kind of a Funny Story,Galifianakis [is] able to turn on a dime; balancing his disarming humour with moments of anguished outbreaks. His is one of the best supporting performances of recent memory; equally funny and heartbreaking. If only I could say the same of the movie.,NEGATIVE
It: Chapter Two,"It Chapter Two is a good conclusion to the Losers Club story. It definitely has more Stephen King flair than the first film, but gives you everything you’d want from a supernatural horror. ",POSITIVE
It: Chapter Two,Too many things weigh the movie down and keep it from resonating like the first chapter&#46; And too much time is squandered in the wrong places&#46;,NEGATIVE
It: Chapter Two,"Despite the luxurious 170-minute runtime, Chapter Two feels hastily assembled, oddly brief and bloated at the same time, and beneath the text on which it was based.",NEGATIVE
It: Chapter Two,Episode 48: Ready or Not / It Chapter Two / Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,NEGATIVE

J. Edgar,An exquisitely made piece.,POSITIVE
J. Edgar,A well done biopic featuring a couple of fine performances from DiCaprio and Hammer.,POSITIVE

Jack Reacher,There's quite a bit of fun to be had in the film if you're willing to lower your expectations.,POSITIVE
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,Despite the efforts of Cruise and Smulders&#44; things never rise above predictable and&#47;or formulaic&#46;,NEGATIVE
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,"Exclusively suited for those with a particular interest in this intellectual property, especially given the low-rent quality of the story and production.",NEGATIVE
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,"A kind of grittier cousin to the Mission: Impossible films, Never Go Back doesnt stray much from the Tom Cruise action formula, but that will be just fine for most.",POSITIVE
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,"It's a shame Popstar arrived in theaters first, because a better title for the dreary Jack Reacher: Never Go Back would have been Jack Reacher: Never Stop Never Stopping.",NEGATIVE
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,Clear and present slumber&#46;,NEGATIVE
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,Is this a formula that we ive seen before&#63; Absolutely&#46; But when I im enjoying myself&#44; I just don it care&#46;,POSITIVE

Jack and Jill,"Sandler is hit-and-miss here, with a definite miss virtually every time he shows up as Jill.",NEGATIVE
Jack and Jill,I'm not saying we SHOULD take Pacino's Oscar away from him because of this movie. I'm just saying that's a conversation I'm willing to have.,NEGATIVE

Jackass 3,These guys are the taunting yet fiercely loyal friends we've kind of always wanted in our lives.,POSITIVE
Jackass 3,I think a blanket apology to both audiences and the cast themselves would be more appropriate - it should never have come to this.,NEGATIVE
Jackass 3,"Jackass 3D is incredibly stupid, but it's also hands down one of the funniest and most entertaining movies I've seen all year. Anyone who thinks differently just doesn't have a sense of humor and needs to lighten up a bit.",POSITIVE
Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa,"Amidst all the chaos and naughtiness, there's an unabashed celebration of the human spirit here that left me simultaneously laughing and crying.",POSITIVE
Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa,You can laugh at poop and fart jokes for only so long; sooner or later all the pooping and farting will start to stink.,NEGATIVE

Jackass: Number Two,"Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera and company prod themselves into a hilariously fascinating exploration, and exploitation, of their own psychological fears. After all, a director like Spike Jonze wouldn't be a hanger-on if there were no subtext.",POSITIVE
Jackass: The Movie,"I can accept that many find this entertaining, however, I'm just not one of them.",NEGATIVE
Jackass: The Movie,More idiotic and dangerous than the show. Really.,NEGATIVE
Jackass: The Movie,"Superficial shenanigans don't diminish its effect. It's a ridiculously funny barrage of taboo pranks, practical jokes and tests of both social altruism and Bam Margera's parents' patience - most of it failsafed so that the foolishness never subsides.",POSITIVE
Jackass: The Movie,The movie is designed to play for one audience and one audience only: existing Jackass fans.,NEGATIVE
Jackpot,The Polish brothers are clearly talented; all they need now is a story that's more interesting than this one.,NEGATIVE
Jackpot,The Polish brothers are onto something about their view of small-towns in the western part of America...,POSITIVE
Jackpot,"""Jackpot"" is a downbeat but effective character study ...",POSITIVE
Jackpot,"For anyone interested in a movie that wipes clean the grungy patina of self-delusionment, Jackpot hits solid pay dirt.",POSITIVE
Jane Eyre,The story is anchored by some wonderful performances&#44; great costume and set design&#44; and it is moody yet captivating cinematography&#46;,POSITIVE
Jane Eyre,The film should only cement the growing reputation of Wasikowska.,POSITIVE
Jane Eyre,This Jane Eyre adaptation far surpasses any of the previous film versions by benefiting from a master execution by director Cary Fukunaga. [Full review in Spanish],POSITIVE
Jane Eyre,It really is hard to find a fault with this latest adaptation of Jane Eyre. It's certainly one of the most tonally stringent period films of recent years.,POSITIVE
Japanese Story,An underdeveloped film that requires all of [Collette's] ample skills merely to rise to the mediocre.,NEGATIVE
Japanese Story,A heartbreaking and complex film about human relationships.,POSITIVE
Japanese Story,"Lots of pictures begin strongly only to lose their focus; this one gains momentum with every sequence -- ambivalent at first, we're firmly hooked by the final frame.",POSITIVE

Jason Bourne,It is a bit slow out of the gate&#44; but when it gets its footing it falls right in line with the franchise&#46;,POSITIVE
Jason Bourne,"When it's made with the level of energy that Greengrass applies, it's difficult not to be entertained.",POSITIVE
Jason Bourne,While the weakest of the original three&#44; Jason Bourne is still entertaining and good enough to warrant the price of admission&#46;,POSITIVE
Jason Bourne,"Jason Bourne is more indecipherable and unformed than ever, with Damon not given much more to do than shoot, brawl, bleed and run.",NEGATIVE
Jason X,It's not a good movie. Literally no one expects Jason X -- the 10th sequel in the Friday the 13th series -- to be good.,NEGATIVE
Jason X,"There's a lot of dumb fun to be had here, so it only sucks on a few levels.",POSITIVE
Jason X,I had forgotten why I only remember the trailer for this dumb horror movie. [Full review in Spanish].,NEGATIVE
Jason X,"Although Jason X didn't achieve nearly the popularity that follow-up Freddie vs. Jason did, it's overall a better film with more imagination... funnier lines and more gnarly kills.",POSITIVE
Jayne Mansfield's Car,Zany but strained period piece dramedy.,NEGATIVE
Jayne Mansfield's Car,"Jayne Mansfield's Car is dramatic and funny and entertaining in many parts, but the jigsaw puzzle doesn't always flow from piece to piece. For all of Thornton's directing skill, the overall film can be episodic and loses focus repeatedly.",POSITIVE
Jayne Mansfield's Car,The truly superb cast of Jayne Mansfield's Car sputters in this confused melodrama that is more pre-occupied with explicitly saying everything rather than genuinely saying something.,NEGATIVE
Jayne Mansfield's Car,It's obvious that Billy Bob Thornton is attempting something meaningful with Jayne Mansfield's Car. It's just tough to figure out what it is.,NEGATIVE
Jeepers Creepers,There's a menace to it that creates a lot of tension&#44; and the direction makes all the right moves&#44; but the proverbial &quot;big reveal&quot; makes the whole thing seem more than a little ridiculous&#46;,NEGATIVE
Jeepers Creepers,There's little doubt that Salva delivers an almost astonishingly effective opening stretch&#46;&#46;&#46;,POSITIVE
Jeepers Creepers,"An absurd horror yarn in which a cannibalistic winged demon goes on a murderous rampage whenever he hears the title tune. Personally, ""Sussudio"" and ""Rude"" are the only songs that would conceivably make me take a hatchet to someone's head, but I digress.",NEGATIVE
Jeepers Creepers,A good way to find some genuinely creepy moments in a decade where they were short in supply.,POSITIVE
"Jeff, Who Lives at Home",Audiences are bound to fall for Segel is teddy bear sweetness and the genial way the characters manage to work out their problems&#46;,POSITIVE
"Jeff, Who Lives at Home",Judy Greer also turns in what may be a career best performance.,POSITIVE
"Jeff, Who Lives at Home","[The Duplass brothers'] best film to date. In fact, this post-Mumblecore endearing effort from the directing duo happens to be one of the most funny, touching, and entertaining films of the year as well.",POSITIVE
"Jeff, Who Lives at Home","Part mumblecore kitchen sink drama, part paranormal detective story, this sibling bromance adds a fresh and engaging approach to the domestic comedy template.",POSITIVE
Jersey Boys,&#8230;a straight bio-pic&#44; with diegetic music only either as the soundtrack to montages or when the band perform&#8230;,POSITIVE
Jersey Boys,Eastwood is firmly established love of music doesn it necessarily mean he is attuned to the snappy&#44; energetic presentation this production required to both channel the Broadway show and ensnare moviegoers&#46;,NEGATIVE
Jersey Boys,"Like a coin-operated jukebox that relies on push buttons, stacks of vinyl and electric inner workings to make music, Jersey Boys feels like a mechanical retelling of the popular Broadway show.",NEGATIVE

Jersey Girl,This film should have been much better than it is.,POSITIVE
Jersey Girl,A gem that is bound to be misconstrued.,POSITIVE
Jersey Girl,Director Kevin Smith's first non-View Askewniverse effort...,POSITIVE
Jersey Girl,"But the formulaic nature of ``Jersey Girl'' and its unabashed embrace of suds makes it awfully sweet stuff. ``Jersey Girl'' is [Kevin] Smith at his most tender but not, alas, at his most original.",NEGATIVE
Jesus' Son,Alison Maclean takes an uncommon approach to a common theme and comes up with a film that is nothing short of a revelation.,POSITIVE
Jesus' Son,takes some different turns,POSITIVE
Jesus' Son,"JESUS' SON is bottom of the line trash that wants to be art. Full of self important crap, tedious performances, and embarrassing experimental flourishes, this is a movie to avoid at all costs.",NEGATIVE
Jesus' Son,"While one is able to get interested in FH's internal workings, it's more difficult to get too invested in his external actions--that is, on rare occasion he does act rather than react.",NEGATIVE
Jet Lag,"While the movie is unfolding, you don't mind being persuaded by its benevolence and gracefulness.",POSITIVE
Jet Lag,"Charming in its predictability, yet not without its pleasures. The leads share a very casual chemistry, an odd couple that refreshingly isn't at odds with each other.",POSITIVE
Jet Lag,"In the realm of predictable rom-coms, this one has enough charm and humor to divert us for an hour and a half.",POSITIVE
Jet Lag,"The idea of gruff, scruffy Reno and the elegant- as-ever Binoche getting together is far too ridiculous to swallow even for a minute.",NEGATIVE
Jigsaw,"Gorehounds will get their fill, and that's about the limit of Jigsaw's appeal.",NEGATIVE
Jigsaw,Jigsaw will in no way&#44; shape or form be a game changer for the horror genre&#46;,NEGATIVE
Jigsaw,"""The horror genre typically sees women as passive and helpless, the perfect victims. But when the roles are reversed, a female killer reclaims some power.""",NEGATIVE
Jigsaw,"Though slicker and better-directed than any prior Saw film, Jigsaw's tame gore and rehashed plot twists make it mostly fall flat.",NEGATIVE
Jimmy's Hall,Ken Loach has fashioned one of his purest and most lovely films here in Jimmy's Hall.,POSITIVE
Jimmy's Hall,"The film feels flat, self-consciously preachy and not a patch on my own favourite, Land And Freedom.",NEGATIVE
Jimmy's Hall,"Barry Ward's handsome, charismatic hero is a romanticised figure (in reality Gralton was middle-aged and balding), which wouldn't matter if his character had been given more depth and shade.",NEGATIVE
Jimmy's Hall,"A handsomely mounted, yet modest and precise piece of work that unearths a little-known true story of injustice and reminds us all of how the present is always in the shadow of the past.",POSITIVE
Jindabyne,"Subtle and understated, a meditation on morality, mortality and murder that escalates into a small emotional powerhouse.",POSITIVE
Jindabyne,"Although Jindabyne's cinematography features sweeping scenes of the Australian countryside as stunning as any of those opening shots from Brokeback Mountain, it ultimately has some bigger issues.",NEGATIVE
Jindabyne,Less a moral dilemma than a meditation on the differences between men and women in matters of social decorum.,POSITIVE
Jindabyne,Intense relationship drama for adults only.,POSITIVE
Joe Dirt,"In place of anything resembling a plot, the movie wheels-out a tired collection of set-piece gross-outs for Joe to endure.",NEGATIVE
Joe Dirt,"Crass, formulaic comedy with bullying, cartoonish violence.",NEGATIVE
Joe Dirt,...none of it is funny.,NEGATIVE
Joe Dirt,"Sally forth, gentle viewer, and enjoy yourself. En route, you will experience a steady supply of doo-doo jokes, dispensed in seven-minute intervals by the Script-O-Tron 3000TM.",NEGATIVE
Joe Somebody,Talented actors are wasted on bad script.,NEGATIVE
Joe Somebody,Much of the running time is devoted to dramatic subplots and other such misguided attempts at pathos.,NEGATIVE
Joe Somebody,There is a definite threat behind this man's eyes.,POSITIVE
Joe Somebody,"Bearing clear marks of a film made strictly to pay the bills, its performances are phoned in and its direction is eminently average.",NEGATIVE
John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars,A fun and underrated movie deserving of any Carpenter fan is affection&#46;,POSITIVE
John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars,"...the public didn't get it, but Ghosts of Mars has great action scenes, some cool tension, and funny dialogue...",POSITIVE
John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars,"No one's favorite John Carpenter movie, least of all Carpenter. But it's much like Carpenter's Jack Burton character - amusingly cocksure in its constant clamoring, prone to the wrong place at the wrong time, similarly accidental in success it finds.",POSITIVE
John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars,"With the synthesizer-heavy soundtrack, practical gore effects, and macho attitudes, the film is instantly recognizable as a work by director John Carpenter.",NEGATIVE
John Q,I liked this movie but some of the performances like Eddie Griffin threw the tone off a bit&#46; But all in all&#44; Denzel does such a great job in this film and does everything he can to carry it to the finish line&#46;,POSITIVE
John Q,Denzel carries this movie on his back&#44; which saves the movie from fully drowning&#46; It should've been a great Denzel movie but because of its flaws&#44; it is just &quot;ok&quot;&#46; ,POSITIVE
John Q,Thought-provoking. Too intense for young teens.,POSITIVE
John Q,"Strands good actors in mushy, movie-of-the-week material. [Blu-ray]",NEGATIVE
John Tucker Must Die,The only one who's getting screwed over in this film is the audience.,NEGATIVE
John Tucker Must Die,"Designed as an ultimate revenge fantasy ""John Tucker Must Die"" is a moderately funny teen comedy with a few flashes of bawdy humor.",NEGATIVE
John Tucker Must Die,"Rarely has a title promised so much, and delivered so little. John Tucker Must Die is toothless, gormless, witless, and, worst of all, deathless.",NEGATIVE
John Tucker Must Die,"Had it mined edgier territory and stuck to its guns, it would've proven a more engaging vehicle than the mild laugher we have here",NEGATIVE
John Wick,As you would expect from former stunt coordinators&#44; the action scenes are dynamic and that might be enough&#44; but the emotional thread that motivates Chapter One is exceptionally constructed&#44; justifying much of the rage and murder&#46;,POSITIVE
John Wick,It is definitely a movie made for a particular audience&#44; and if wall-to-wall action and stylized violence isn it your cup of tea&#44; neither is &#8220;John Wick&#8221;&#46;,POSITIVE
John Wick,For all of its familiar plot elements&#44; the movie knows when to step back&#44; let Keanu do his thing&#44; and watch the impressive fight and gunplay choreography throughout&#46;,POSITIVE
John Wick,The directors find new ways to stage and frame these deadly encounters in a way that constantly feels fresh and exciting.,POSITIVE
Johnny English,Right down there with the worst of Peter Sellers' Pink Panther quickies.,NEGATIVE
Johnny English,"Johnny English is more I Spy than the genuine genius of Austin Powers. It ain't great, but it's funny because he's funny.",NEGATIVE
Johnny English,The spy parts aren't exciting enough and the funny parts aren't funny enough.,NEGATIVE
Johnny English,"While it lives up to the very definition of 'hit and miss', the parts that hit are very funny.",POSITIVE
Johnny English Reborn,An unnecessary sequel to a mostly forgettable film.,NEGATIVE
Johnny English Reborn,"If the troubled Bond franchise needs inspiration on how to reinvent itself, it could do worse than to look to Johnny English Reborn. The secret is not to take it so seriously.",POSITIVE
Johnny English Reborn,"Johnny English Reborn is amusing in parts and arguably better than the original, but ultimately it is a throwaway giggle for kids and indulgent parents.",NEGATIVE
Johnny English Reborn,Half-assed spoofs like this just don't work and come off as rather lazy and lame.,NEGATIVE

Johnson Family Vacation,"Mechanical performances by Vanessa Williams and Bow Wow, as Nate's musically inclined son, impair Cedric's earnest comedic efforts in this spasmodic comedy.",NEGATIVE
Johnson Family Vacation,"I really wanted to like this movie, especially since I'm a fan of Cedric the Entertainer.",NEGATIVE
Johnson Family Vacation,...Cedric the Entertainer simply cannot act.,NEGATIVE
Jojo Rabbit,Delightfully one of the year’s best films.,POSITIVE
Jojo Rabbit,Much of the comedy is too broad to truly satirise the subject matter&#46;&#46;&#46; unable to nail the emotional beats when it finally confronts the true reality and horror of the situation&#46;,NEGATIVE
Jojo Rabbit,The film is ability to make you laugh&#44; cry&#44; or be utterly appalled is one of its many strengths&#46;,POSITIVE
Jojo Rabbit,This was the movie that made me laugh and cry the most in 2019&#46; It created this absolutely perfect mixture between satire and drama&#46; Every joke hits all the good spots&#46; Waititi's best work&#63; Probably&#46; &#91;Full review in Spanish&#93;,POSITIVE
Joshua,Far from perfect. But Joshua regards the creepy factor in a realistic setting. Everything that happens is uncannily possible. [Full review in Spanish].,POSITIVE
Joshua,"Easily written off as an ""Omen"" retread at first glance, this unfairly passed-over piece of slow-burn terror disarmingly chipped away at ideas of parental readiness with mounting dread and gruesome humor. It burrows beneath the skin and stays there.",POSITIVE
Joshua,Anyone who's ever heard (or just imagined) troubling sounds coming from a fuzzy baby monitor or fretted while their fifth-grader traversed a big-city crosswalk will have their nerves seriously jangled by Joshua.,POSITIVE
Joshua,An absurd and unconvincing fright pic.,NEGATIVE
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,There is nothing about this family-friendly movie that is outrageously offensive&#44; but there is nothing about it that is particularly interesting&#44; well-executed&#44; or inventively conceived either&#46;,NEGATIVE
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,...entertaining yet chintzy...,POSITIVE
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,A screenplay that never quite clicks on all cylinders. There are too many scenes dealing with relationships that really halt any momentum.,NEGATIVE
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,"Undeniably an exhilarating family friendly, action adventure that'll no doubt thrill younger audiences.",POSITIVE
Joyful Noise,Parton also is quite game to poke fun of her long-standing history of plastic surgery.,POSITIVE
Joyful Noise,An insane piece of modern cinema that makes me wish I did drugs. Lots of drugs. Hard drugs.,POSITIVE
Joyful Noise,Joyful Noise comes alive in the performance scenes but the dramatic dialogue is so insipid that even good actors sound as though they're reading from a generic cut-and-paste script.,NEGATIVE
Joyful Noise,"When it comes down to it, you'd probably be wiser to stick with Glee. You get roughly the same amount of musical numbers, equally melodramatic storylines and hammy acting in less than half the time.",NEGATIVE

Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,Even with a simple plot&#44; Jumanji&#58; Welcome To The Jungle is so flat-out hysterical that it is a complete joy to watch&#46; The film embraces the silly concept of being sucked into a video game&#44; but never insults the audience is intelligence&#46;,POSITIVE
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,Viewers and gamers alike may have more fun with Pitfall Harry.,NEGATIVE
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,We defy you not to laugh every time The Rock lets loose his eyebrow-tastic signature look. Robin Williams would have been proud.,POSITIVE

Jumper,Frustration over how easily the end product could have been tweaked for the better threatens to negate any positives.,NEGATIVE
Jumper,A disastrously written script. [Full review in Spanish],NEGATIVE
Jupiter Ascending,Another Wachowski movie whose ambition is only surpassed by its flaws&#46;,NEGATIVE
Jupiter Ascending,Fresh because it considers a network of varied planetary systems so expansive that at any moment something random and new from any number of cultures &#40;or subcultures&#41; could appear onscreen&#44; and without need or desire for adequate explanation&#46;,POSITIVE
Jupiter Ascending,Cobbled together with random ideas from the last thirty years of science-fiction cinema.,NEGATIVE

Jurassic Park III,"Almost all of the magic of cinematic dinosaurs is gone, even though further attempts are made to increase the magnitude and intensity of gargantuan reptiles on the loose.",POSITIVE
Jurassic Park III,Jurassic Park III manages to get even darker than the prior films but the sequel doesn't quite capture the magic of the franchise.,NEGATIVE
Jurassic Park III,"Despite all its talk of genetic engineering and its deliberately stupid characters, the unintended message of Jurassic Park III is that when it comes to art and entertainment, you can't beat human DNA.",NEGATIVE
Jurassic World,"Jurassic World lacks heart because everything happens on the same level of fast-paced, forgettable entertainment. [Full review in Spanish]",POSITIVE
Jurassic World,The visual spectacle&#44; the dinosaur fights&#44; the theme park environment all work to immerse you in a really cool setting&#46; It is too bad the underwhelming story&#44; narrative hiccups&#44; and bland characters drag it down to passable but forgettable levels&#46;,POSITIVE

Lost Highway,"Justifiably off-putting in its simple but nonetheless jarring narrative disorientation, Lost Highway is hardly the empty, superficial exercise it was written off as.",POSITIVE
Lost Highway," It looks fantastic, it has a wildly eclectic cast, and most of all, its pure, unadulterated Lynch.",POSITIVE

Lost in Space,"The new robot is a disappointment. Instead of the endearingly low-tech fireplug of yore that warned Will Robinson of encroaching danger, the new machine is all bells and whistles and no fun at all. Kinda like the movie itself.",NEGATIVE
Lost in Space,"Much of the movie plays like a live-action video game, and the sequel-ready ending feels akin to falling off a cliff. But with its appealing mix of heart and adventure, Lost in Space is great fun for children of the '60s or the '90s.",POSITIVE
Lost in Space,"Lost in Space glides along smoothly on special effects and punchy editing. At about the one-hour mark, however, the movie abandons itself to the noise, chaos and empty spectacle of the new-style Hollywood blockbuster, where story ceases to matter.",NEGATIVE

Lottery Ticket,"A tasteless and obnoxious ""comedy,"" ""Lottery Ticket"" is easily one of the year's worst films.",NEGATIVE

Love & Basketball,An exceptional feature writing and directing debut by Gina Prince-Bythewood.,POSITIVE

Love Actually,A collection of touching sketches that are frequently sentimental yet thoroughly grand.,POSITIVE
Love Don't Cost a Thing,Missed opportunity full of dubious messages.,NEGATIVE
Love Don't Cost a Thing,"""Love Don't Cost A Thing"" is loosely based on the 1987 teen comedy ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" and fails to improve on that tepid movie by using a milieu of black high school students.",NEGATIVE
Love Don't Cost a Thing,...the movie borders on cruelty to its audience.,NEGATIVE

Love in the Time of Cholera,"An extraordinary story, with a multinational cast of the highest quality that unexpectedly just does not just ""materialize"" and becomes a conventional film. [Full review in Spanish]",NEGATIVE

Loveless,It's a masterpiece from a filmmaker coming to be known for masterpieces.,POSITIVE

MacGruber,One can't help but be immensely disappointed.,NEGATIVE

MacGruber,"MacGruber fails where every single Saturday Night Live skit-turned-movie, save for Wayne's World, has failed. They take something that is funny for five minutes and think it can be funny for 90 minutes.",NEGATIVE

Machine Gun Preacher,"With an exploitation-friendly title like Machine Gun Preacher you'd think this movie would be the soul brother of Hobo With A Shotgun. Unfortunately, that is not so.",NEGATIVE

Mad Money,Keaton actually tries to save the day.,NEGATIVE
Mad Money,A pleasant surprise that takes a simple (and rather clichéd) premise and milks it for every ounce of entertainment possible.,POSITIVE
Mad Money,"With a plot that borders on the absurd and a happy ending, Mad Money is a film that does not necessarily need to be seen on the giant screen. [Full review in Spanish]",NEGATIVE
Mad Money,"Provided you can get past its improbable premise, this madcap crime caper's trio of talented leading ladies manage to provide enough moments of mirth to make the rest of this raucous romp worthwhile.",POSITIVE
Made,"Slick suits, hip urban nightspots, and an over the top performance by Vince Vaughn make this rambunctious farce an enjoyable and unpredictable movie with some obligatory fist fighting.",POSITIVE
Made,"Vaughn hits the bullseye as a strident, volatile jerk who can't keep his mouth shut. You never really like him, but you can't wait to see what he'll do next -- his missteps and offenses are so unbelievable you wince, but you can't look away.",POSITIVE
Made,"The same offbeat sensibility that informed Swingers is also evident here, except that unlike the 1996 film, which dealt with real issues, Favreau's new crime-comedy is plotless",POSITIVE
Made,The plot seems to be nothing more than a translucent bridge to the next scene where Vaughn can run his mouth and Favreau can play off him as the longsuffering friend,NEGATIVE
Made in Dagenham,Incredibly stirring and inspiring.,POSITIVE
Made in Dagenham,"Made in Dagenham doesn't feel like it is saying anything especially new about either workplace sexism or labor relations. However, it is well-acted, well thought-out and informative enough to be worth watching.",POSITIVE

Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,Much like the original&#44; there's very little charm and excitement to be found in Maleficent&#58; Mistress of Evil&#46; While Jolie looks impressive in her full Maleficent costume&#44; there is little reason to watch the film outside of that&#46; ,NEGATIVE
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,Despite a lackluster third act&#44; Maleficent&#58; Mistress Of Evil still works as a whole&#44; largely thanks to Jolie and Pfeiffer is all-in performances&#46; It may not be much more memorable than the first entry in this franchise&#44; but it is still enjoyable enough&#46;,POSITIVE

My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"My Big Fat Greek Wedding never tries to be more than a fun, funny romantic comedy about an ugly (or perhaps ""dowdy"" is a better word) duckling who blossoms and finds her swan.",POSITIVE
My Bloody Valentine,"Solving the crime and cheering on heroes is something of a lost cause, as most of the roles are just unintelligent enough to inspire disgust.",NEGATIVE
My Bloody Valentine,"Features an abundance of full frontal nudity, courtesy of Betsy Rue, who may very well have the most extended and gratuitous horror film nude scene in quite a few years.",POSITIVE
My Bloody Valentine,More than worthy entertainment thanks to the power of new technologies. [Full review in Spanish],POSITIVE
My Bloody Valentine,"Toss in first-rate 3D and the movie not only pays a proper homage to the 1981 original but kicks it up about 1,000 notches.",POSITIVE
My Blueberry Nights,"A visual masterpiece, Wong Kar-wai's stylized mannerisms waffle between artifice and a certain coldness that is only overcome in the end by dramatic and emotional intensity. ",POSITIVE
My Blueberry Nights,...an awkward exercise in translating Wong kar-Wai to a Western setting.,NEGATIVE

My Blueberry Nights,"In the end, the cinematography and music give off a sultry, smoky vibe that borders on intoxicating, Wong never backs it up with anything of meaning.",NEGATIVE
My Dog Skip,"...a gem of a movie for children and adults, despite its clichs.",POSITIVE
My Dog Skip,"Great boy-and-dog tale, but be prepared for tears.",POSITIVE
My Dog Skip,"Not a mawkish dying-dog tearjerker, ""My Dog Skip"" carries a touch of Mark Twain, with quasi-dangerous tall tales and awareness of a gap between childhood and boyhood. Plus, as it's said of ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"" there's cussin' in it.",POSITIVE
My Dog Skip,Features two irresistible lead characters -- and you can't always say that about a movie.,POSITIVE
My Favorite Martian,A terrible movie -- beware.,NEGATIVE

My Favorite Martian,Walston displays a crisp wit and blithe sense of whimsy otherwise lacking in this loser.,NEGATIVE

My First Mister,The actors earn the couple of salty drops you may shed at the end -- the script sure doesn't&#46;,POSITIVE

My First Mister,"...while Ghost World is, on the whole, a slightly better movie, My First Mister is nevertheless worth checking out mostly due to two incredible lead performances.",POSITIVE
My Little Pony: The Movie,"Given that the story centers on toy pony princesses with magical abilities, My Little Pony: The Movie contains multitudes to unpack.",POSITIVE
My Little Pony: The Movie,"A pretty shallow experience, which is functionally fine for distracting a small child for over an hour but somewhat disappointing for adults and fans hoping to get something out of the experience too.",NEGATIVE
My Little Pony: The Movie,There's nothing here meant to be taken seriously and there's simply nothing here that can be taken seriously.,NEGATIVE
My Little Pony: The Movie,A dream of dark and troubling things.,NEGATIVE
My Soul to Take,Virtually every aspect of production disappoints.,NEGATIVE

My Soul to Take,"My Soul to Take is a little uneven, but at its best, it's remarkably good.",POSITIVE
My Soul to Take,"What [Wes Craven] wound up with was a witless stab-the-teen time-waster that could be his worst film ever. And considering 2005's wretched Cursed, that's pretty bad.",NEGATIVE
My Summer of Love,"A spare, simple movie, but its simplicity is a great strength.",POSITIVE
My Summer of Love,"This is a rare, cogent, powerful, intelligent little film from a major cinematic talent.",POSITIVE
My Summer of Love,"For what Pawlikowski has ultimately crafted is an ingenious, fresh variant on the quintessentially British theme of class.",POSITIVE

"Mystery, Alaska","La preuve qu'il est encore possible de produire de belles choses lorsque la passion est au rendez-vous, mme si cela signifie parfois travailler avec des matriaux uss...",POSITIVE
"Mystery, Alaska","With so many characters and plotlines, it seems that TV king Kelley mistook this big-screen assignment for another network pilot.",NEGATIVE
Mystic River,Clint Eastwood has infused the picture with a typically deliberate and methodical feel that certainly complements Brian Helgeland's somewhat drawn-out screenplay...,POSITIVE
Mystic River,"Eastwood tells the story simply, barely moving the camera. The only special effect in this film is genius.",POSITIVE
Mystic River,"The entire cast did a phenomenal job, resisting the urge to overact too much, which is what you get for a film like this.",POSITIVE
Mystic River,Powerful performances in graphic story. Only 16+.,POSITIVE
