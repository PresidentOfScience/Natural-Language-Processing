4,If you've ever been to Disneyland anywhere you'll find Disneyland Hong Kong very similar in the layout when you walk into main street! It has a very familiar feel. One of the rides  its a Small World  is absolutely fabulous and worth doing. The day we visited was fairly hot and relatively busy but the queues moved fairly well. 
4,"Its been a while since d last time we visit HK Disneyland .. Yet, this time we only stay in Tomorrowland .. AKA Marvel land!Now they have Iron Man Experience n d Newly open Ant Man n d Wasp!!Ironman .. Great feature n so Exciting, especially d whole scenery of HK (HK central area to Kowloon)!Antman .. Changed by previous Buzz lightyear! More or less d same, but I'm expecting to have something most!!However, my boys like it!!Space Mountain .. Turns into Star Wars!! This 1 is Great!!!For cast members (staffs) .. Felt bit MINUS point from before!!! Just dun feel like its a Disney brand!! Seems more local like Ocean Park or even worst!!They got no SMILING face, but just wanna u to enter n attraction n leave!!Hello this is supposed to be Happiest Place on Earth brand!! But, just really Dont feel it!!Bakery in Main Street now have more attractive delicacies n Disney theme sweets .. These are Good Points!!Last, they also have Starbucks now inside the theme park!!"
4,"Thanks God it wasn   t too hot or too humid when I was visiting the park   otherwise it would be a big issue (there is not a lot of shade).I have arrived around 10:30am and left at 6pm. Unfortunately I didn   t last until evening parade, but 8.5 hours was too much for me.There is plenty to do and everyone will find something interesting for themselves to enjoy.It wasn   t extremely busy and the longest time I had to queue for certain attractions was 45 minutes (which is really not that bad).Although I had an amazing time, I felt a bit underwhelmed with choice of rides and attractions. The park itself is quite small (I was really expecting something grand   even the main castle which was closed by the way was quite small).The food options are good, few coffee shops (including Starbucks) and plenty of gift shops. There was no issue with toilets as they are everywhere.All together it was a great day out and I really enjoyed it."
4,"HK Disneyland is a great compact park. Unfortunately there is quite a bit of maintenance work going on at present so a number of areas are closed off (including the famous castle) If you go midweek, it is not too crowded and certainly no where near as bus as LA Disneyland. We did notice on this visit that prices for food, drinks etc have really gone through the roof so be prepared to pay top dollar for snacks (and avoid the souvenir shops if you can) Regardless, kids will love it."
4,"the location is not in the city, took around 1 hour from Kowlon, my kids like disneyland so much, everything is fine.   but its really crowded and hot in Hong Kong"
3,"Have been to Disney World, Disneyland Anaheim and Tokyo Disneyland but I feel that Disneyland Hong Kong is really too small to be called a Disneyland. It has way too few rides and attractions. Souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other Disneyland as well. Basically, this park is good only for small children and people who has never been to Disney. The food choices were acceptable, mostly fast food, and not too expensive. Bottled water, however, was VERY expensive but they do have water fountains around for you to refill your water bottles. The parade was pretty good. It was crowded not a problem but what was the problem was the people were just so rude, the pushing and shoving cutting in lines for the rides, gift shops, food stands was just to much to take. forget trying to see one of the shows its a free for all for seats, i don't see how Disney can let this happen, it was by far the worst managed Disney property."
5,Great place! Your day will go by and you won't even know it. Obviously went there for my daughter and she absolutely loved it! Too bad the parade got canceled though.
3,"Think of it as an intro to Disney magic for the little ones. Almost all of the attractions can be completed in 1.5days.One drawback was the timing. For example, Disney's Storybook Theatre is closed Wed Thu for private events. Some restaurants close mid week Tue Thur as well. So best not to plan your visit during mid week.The biggest disappointment is the food at the Park. Even Maxim's is so so only. The only decent Restaurant is Main Street Corner Cafe and the Main Street Bakery. And do be prepared for the typical abrupt HongKong style service from the serving staff."
2,"Feel so let down with this place,the Disneyland train was fantastic until you get past the station,bad signage, terrible staff who just did not want to be there ,it was rainning and rides were not working could not find a map of place, over priced fun park. Disney characters only 2 seen under a cabana having photos with visitors queuing up in the rain. Dont waste your money. Walt Disney would be horrified, not enough eating places for the amount of people or rest rooms. Seems they are building something but who knows what. No atmosphere of fun and fantasy. "
5,"I can go on talking about Disneyland. Whatever I say about it, is less. Disneyland is all about your childhood dreams come true. Starting from the Entrance, the environment, popcorn, the shows, everything. Even the MTR Trains and the station is specially designed. In my opinion one should by a Two Day Ticket to explore it well if you have time. Else few of the attractions may remain incomplete in one day. An online Two Day Ticket can save around HKD 100 in comparison to an on spot ticket.  Must NOT Miss  attractions include the Jungle River Cruise, Micky's Phillhar Magic (a 4D Show), The Lion King ShowIt is better to have some home work regarding the Show Timings so that you can maximise the number of shows you can cover. It is better to avoid Sundays or the public holidays to avoid rush."
5,Disneyland never cease to amaze me! I've been to Disneyland florida and I thought I have exhausted the kid in me but nope! I still had so much fun in disneyland hong kong. 2 DL off my bucketlist and more to come!     
5,"We spent the day here with our grown kids and I have to admit we had a great time. It seems the kids never tire of Disney. There aren   t as many rides as the states Disney parks but they have some great ones no less. Do the haunted house, catch the lion king show, space mountain, and the iron man experience to list a few. They have lots of shops that you have to spend some money in of course. The kids will love the day!"
4,"We spend two days, the second day went early then went straight to the back of the park, no lineups for so children got to go on many rides, some twice in a row. This Disneyland is very suitable for young children ours were 7,6,5,4,3 and 1 so most of them could go on all the rides, it was disappointing the castle was closed no nightly fireworks. Would not like to go in the hot season."
5,It was indeed the happiest place on earth! My family had really fun and it made my daughter's birthday a memorable one!
5,"This place is HUGE! Definately need more than one day. We had 3 children aged 11, 9 & 6 and they loved it. A great variety of rides and attractions for all ages. Food options were fantastic with 3D models of what you were ordering. Staff were fantastic, very helpful. An awesome family experience. "
3,"We brought tickets before we left and got 2 days for less than the price of 1. After visiting would advise everyone to look for an online deal not worth the walk up price. Castle was closed due to that area being refurbished and altered, weekday aprox no more than a 30 min wait for rides with most being less than that would not recommend weekends or holidays. As has been said like all Disney parks and theme parks in general food and drink is expensive .This is a small park and can easily be done in 1 day"
4,"Its huge , not enough to visit in one day. We did with 2 days pass ... all the scenes were amazing ... you were like in movies, fairytales, etc. At 8 pm, we have enjoyed lots with the character show on the street. Must Visit !!! "
3,Around   60 per person and if you want to eat or drink at any point it was cost you a small fortune. If you go on a week day like we did I assume like us you will wait around half an hour per ride. At the time we went the Disney castle was under construction.. it doesn't look like it will be finished soon. Fast track is free for everyone but single rider was a lot faster. An average day at an expensive place. 
4,It   s Disneyland! It just does not need reviewing!  Place speaks for itself.  However smaller than I expected.  Great experience
5,There is nothing more to say except that you become a child once again as you step inside Disneyland in HK!  Easy to go and come out with dedicated trams and subway stations.  Wait for the parade at sunset it is definitely worth waiting!
5,"We bought a 2 day tourist ticket via Klook which made it better value. It was good to have a day to get our bearings and a second day to go on the rides we missed and to go back on our favourite ones again. It also means less queuing.The shows and parades were amazing. We saw the Lion King, Moana and Mickey   s Wondrous Book. Unfortunately there is some works on so the Castle isn   t visible and the train is not open. We still had a magical time.  "
3,"First off I'm not a really big Disneyland fan. I live about 20 minutes from the California Disneyland, and haven't been in over 10 years (by choice). We were on vacation in Hong Kong and were able to get free tickets, so why not. First getting there by subway from downtown was super easy. I will say I was impressed with how the train that takes you there was decked out in all the Disney themes. Next the park was okay just super small compared to the one here in California. The castle was under construction so that kinda of sucks and the train didn't run. We went on a Wednesday so it was slow. There are not a lot of rides, so please don't come with that idea. It's a nice place for little kids, but thrill seekers stay at home. One tip make sure you read the description of each ride before you wait in line, because I will never get those 30 minutes of my life back (Iron man experience)."
3,Mickey and the Wounderous book was great and the kids love it. The new Ant man attraction was good for all ages. Our four year old love the pubs afraid waiting in line because of the loud noises. The 10 year old was afraid of Iron Man   s ride it   s good for 12 and I   ll probably but it was a great ride. The castle is under major construction so there   s no fireworks. Overall the park is still beautiful and wonderful to visit and buy the teacup ride there is a good restaurant that has Standard Chinese food at reasonable prices for Disney. You   ll Have a great day or two. Still probably the best attraction in Hong Kong for children one of the top two for sure. Adults can go on roller coasters and other rides as well they will not be disappointed. 
3,"I   ve been to Hong Kong Disneyland twice and even with new attractions such as the Ant Man and the Wasp, the experience was really flat and not as enjoyable as other Disneylands in the region. With Sleeping Beauty Castle under renovation, pictures taken at the main square isn   t that appealing with the scaffolding in sight. Souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other Disneylands. "
5,"GO early if you want to do photos with the signboards and Mickey Donald Duck. Otherwise, you could spend an hour just waiting in line to get a free photo. The paid photo is also available at a price.Tomorrow land Iron Man was excellent and we did it twice.Philar Magic is really awesome.Fantasy Land is great for the rides.Adventure Land has some nice opportunities to take photos with Tarzan, a treetop house visit, a boat cruise for kids.Grizzly Gulch was one of my favourites, Roller Coaster ride was worth the 15 minute wait."
3,Disneylands the world over are generic apart from the language. This was no different than the others. It was a shame about all the building work and some closed eating areas.  Definitely worth a visit if you have young children.
3,"This was my second trip here, the first been about 3 years ago. This is a smallish Disneyland park. The attractions are of a high standard but there are few thrill rides and no outdoor roller coaster. The park was clean and tidy. Food was expensive in the park not of an excellent qualify (ie served like warm or cold) and there were few vegetarian options.The castle was under renovation at the time of my visit. The park is easy to walk around and many of the attractions are great for kids. Lines were virtually non existent with our longest wait 20 minutesOverall worth a visit if you are with the kids in Hong Kong and have the time. The park entry is also comparatively inexpensive when compared to other Disneyland parks."
5,We have been to Hong Kong Disneyland a few times already but we still want to come back. Why? Because there are rides we were too chicken to try the first visits that we finally had the courage to try and we ended up loving them. We love the Big Grizzly Mountain ride. We thought it will be too scary but we love it now. Will be back again!
5,We visited here on a Wednesday. We arrived for opening and found the queue times to be short and had done most the rides we wanted to by early afternoon. Unfortunately there were no fireworks due to the castle being renovated and we have seen many parades at Disney world so we decided not to stay for the evening. 
3,"I need to say I have been to    home of Disney    Disneyland Anaheim. HK Disney is about an 8th of that park!    Biggest ride    (as in scary) was Space Mountain. Mostly kiddy rides other than that. We did really enjoy the Lion King show. I can   t get over how expensive it was. Water equates to $6 AUD a small bottle and a burger combo meal equated $22 AUD!!!! We also stayed at Disney Hollywood Hotel   where they have u by the balls and charge insane prices ($120 AUD) for buffet dinner or $55 AUD for breakfast. There are no shops   cafes   supermarkets nearby to grab a snack or cheap dinner, unless u take 2 trains! After travelling thru HK  China for 3 weeks it was just crazy expensive for crappy deep fried food or a flavourless bowl of lettuce salad. Very few food places open. Castle under maintenance. Train under maintenance. vouchers we got on the way in stating ALL shops on main st have 10% discount before 1030... then told at bakery    that not here   ?!!! At home that   s called false advertising?!! Toy Story land was insanely hot   no shade, sun bouncing off light concrete   my husband actually had a hypo while waiting for daughter on ride coz it   s so hot. Come on Disneyland... surely you can put up some    camo style shades    so waiting parents don   t pass out?! A few seats for elderly wouldn   t go astray either. All up pretty disappointing experience and about $900 AUD poorer, for 2 adults & 1 child for 2 day pass (note: u won   t need to go back for a second day). "
5,"Took a five year old and a two year old. Could not fault anything other than a hire pram being pinched, which was quickly replaced.  Staff amazing. If you can stay at one of the hotels, do so.  Makes it all much easier."
4,"A great day out even for adults.We can early and we're able to do almost all rides in a couple of hours. The restaurants were great and a good selection of different foods. Try the caramel popcorn! Unfortunately, when we went the bars and 1 restaurant was closed, but still other options available.The rides are mostly for little kids bit a couple were good for adults. The shopping was the highlight of the day with huge selection of Disney gifts and clothing. Note if there is a daily special get it early as it will sell out. There is not a lot of shade so bring hats and an umbrella."
5,"I went to Hong Kong Disneyland with a little trepidation as our family had been to Disneyland in California 6 months previously.No trepidation needed, we all loved HKDL! Loved loved loved it.Yes, its much smaller than California and there are not as many fast paced rides, none the less, we had a great day. The park is beautiful and the experience is just like being at Anaheim.We went on a day where large amounts of rain were expected, so numbers were down. We had line ups of less than 5 minutes on most rides. The rain held off until 3pm and we'd been able to go through all of the park by that time and we were going back over rides we wanted to do again. Once the rain started we found that most people huddled under their umbrellas, where as we went on all the undercover rides over and over.I totally recommend HKDL, just keep in mind it is smaller and slower paced than other Disney parks."
5,"This Disneyland is a lot of fun. There are many rides that are good like the Iron man experience, hyperspace mountain, the toy story car, and many others. I went to Shanghai Disneyland as well and that one is so crowded you can   t go on a lot of rides but in Hong Kong we were able to ride almost every ride in a day. Lines were very short and the park is small so it   s easy to get around. "
4,"We have been to Disneyland in LA two times, and Tokyo Disneyland Disney Sea. Walking through the gates at HK Disneyland felt like going back to LA. This is because the park is owned by Disney and HK Government. We loved the quietness of HK Disneyland in the morning, most things in HK don't open until 10am, so to walk in with very few people in front of us was great. Toy Storyland doesn't open until 11am. We purchased our tickets online from Australia and printed them before we left. You are sent an email with a link to an electronic version with QR codes and personalised characters, but we used the printed version much easier and the website can be a little slow. We also purchased the Dining Vouchers as well, this entitled us to Lunch or Dinner a popcorn or a iceblock. If you are there for two days, like we were then just double the number of vouchers you purchase. HK Disneyland uses the old style Fast pass system, scan your ticket and get a printed fastpass. We were staying at Disney Explorers Lodge and received fast passes to certain rides from there as well. The food in HK Disneyland is aimed at the Asian Market, although there are restaurants who serve burgers etc. If you have fussy eaters then beware you may have limited choices, but over all the food was Disney quality. We ate at the Starliner Restaurant at Tomorrowland.We loved Space Mountain with the Star Wars overlay, sooo coool. The is no Pirates of the Caribbean ride, sad, but the Lion King show and Mickey's PhilharMagic shows are great fun.Unique to the HK Disneyland is Mystic Manor, an amazing trackless ride so fun we went on it three times, the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars is great fun, the experience varies depending on where you are sitting, we had front row, amazing, and last row, still fun but a little rough. Also unique to HK Disneyland is the Iron Man Experience, a ride simulator on a Stark Industries flyer through Hong Kong. Lots of fun.When you ride the Jungle Cruise remember to choose the English line or Cantonese line as the skippers script is done in both. They say there is no difference in the line waiting time, we didn't really notice it.Yes HKL Disneyland is smaller than LA Disneyland  Tokyo Disneyland but two days allows you to see pretty much everything and not a break net speed. We are a Disney loving family and our girls were aged 17, 15, and 10 when we attended the park. The Christmas decorations and the parade were great.HK Disneyland is on the MTR line just change at Sunny Bay Station for the Disneyland line. You can use your Octopus Card to travel on the MTR. There are shuttle buses that run from the Disney Hotels to the transport hub at Disneyland and you can walk if you want to along the bay from the hotels. It would be roughly 20 minutes walk from the Disneyland Hotel along the bay. There is also a ferry that runs from Central to HK Disneyland but the MTR train is the best option in my opinion, especially as it has Mickey Shaped Windows and Disney theming inside the train carriages."
4,Australian family of four with 2 kids (12 and 9) enjoyed a full day out at Hong Kong Disneyland with plenty to do and see.If you have been to other Disney's and get a chance to visit Hong Kong   I say definitely do it. There are a couple of unique Hong Kong experiences including two Marvel attractions   Antman and Ironman   both which we enjoyed.For thrill seekers there are a couple of great rides   The Big Grizzly Mountain was probably our favourite   it was unexpected and fast. And the RC Racer in Toystoryland definitely worth the wait.For families with younger kids there is heaps here to do   we kind of skipped fantasyland   but for young families you would probably spend a lot of the day here.The park is easy to get to as well   the dedicated Disney train line was fun to ride on   and with an easily navigable MTR in Hong Kong it was simple and cheap to get to the Park.
4,"If your are travelling to Disney land from mong cok you can purchase your tickets from one of the travel shops at a discounted rate (we purchased ours from Hong Thai travel) this is in the bank centre on Nathan road, right next to the Mong Kok station.   if you go to level 4 there are numerous travel shops (including CTS) which from other reviews that I read is where most people purchased the tickets. We asked around the shops on level 4 for the price of their Disneyland ticket (including CTS) and we found Hong Thai travel the cheapest. The tickets were $557HKD each for adults. I would recommend asking around each shop for their price on the day. They seem to all open at 10am. The sales advisor will hand you a letter which you then take to the box office at Disney land and swap for entry tickets   it was very easy and we had no problems. Hong Thai travel Bank centre Nathan roadAs the park opened at 10.30am we decided to get a taxi on the way there, this costs roughly $200HKD from Mong Kok and takes around 20 minutes.On the way back we used the trains, the route is:Disney land to Sunny Bay (pink line)Sunny Bay to Lai King Station (orange line)Lai King Station to Mong Kok (red line)The trains costs are around $20HKD and takes roughly 1 hour.  if you want to catch the train to Disneyland from Mong Kok the route is;Mong Kok to Lai King Station (red line)Lai King Station to Sunny Bay Station (orange line)Sunny Bay Station to Disneyland (pink line)"
4,"Hong Kong is easy to get to via the MTR from Kowloon, great signage and fast. Our day started well but just after arriving it started to rain quite heavily and didn't stop until mid afternoon. Characters were out in the main street but only saw two during the day, probably due to the rain. Even though the crowds on entry were big once inside it didn't seem crowded at all, Toy Story Land was a ghost town with no one going on the rides in the rain. We enjoy the rides that were open and all in all had a good day. Had heard great things about Mystic Manor but found it just okay, loved Hyperspace Mountain, Ant Man and Ironman. Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine cars were my favorite of the day! Though shopping wasn't as good as Disneyland in the USA which was disappointing, catering mainly to children. Happy to have visited but don't think I'd go to Hong Kong again."
5,You have to visit to understand the memorable experience. It is a place that brings out the child in everyone. You have to stay for the fireworks. Food is expensive so take snacks along.
5,"HKDL got different event for different period. Like Jan Feb for Chines New Year, Apr May for Spring Carnival, then Summer, Halloween and Christmas, each event got different theme for both charaters costume and decorate, and sometimes might got the special daily parade too. Thats why recommend to check clearly which event you want to join before you make the disney trip. If you don't like crowded, Mar & November without any event happening will be your choice!"
3,The park is great if this is the only amusement park available to you. It is small and the rides are very tame. The park can be done in 3 4 of a day. Disney is always clean and has the best customer service.
5,"Visited here with the family and had a very memorable experience. It didn   t seem as big as Anaheim, but very clean and well maintained.  Received priority queuing passes but didn   t need them as the lines were very short."
4,"It's always going to be fun at Disneyland. These are a few of my reminders: don't bring selfie sticks and huge tripods you can bring bottled water or if you have a reusable container, use that instead food can be expensive so eat plenty before going here. Just don't ride the rollercoasters right away. don't miss the Festival of the Lion King Show. You can forget the Moana production though if you're expecting the songs from the movie and to see Maui wear comfortable shoes. there will be lots of walking have fun and don't get discouraged by long queues. you'll have your turn sooner than you think."
4,"To be honest it rained nearly all day, if the weather was better i'm sure my overall impression would have been much better. It lacks the thrill seeking rides of other disney parks. That being said it also lacked the ridiculously long quees. Waits were around 5 minutes! "
4,"A super small but cute Disney park   if you're a Disney fan you tick this park off in a day though, be warned, if you're used to the service in Walt Disney World and Disneyland, it doesn't seem to  translate  as well at Hong Kong Disneyland. The food is also not as good   we had lunch from the Lucky Nugget Saloon, which was mediocre at best.A fun day though, regardless."
4,"Plaza Inn was fantastic, and the kids in our group loved the rides. It   s smaller than Disneyland, but if you love Disney, it   s worth the visit. If you   re not super into Disney, I   d probably skip and just go to Disneyland in Anaheim."
5,"We first did Disneyworld in Orlando some 40 yrs ago with our 2 year old.Back then, we had to buy different value tickets for various rides whereas that has changed and the entry fee now covers all rides etc, except for food. What hasn   t changed. The place is remarkably clean and well maintained given the number of visitors they see each day. Some rides had a long wait ie 40 minutes, so skipped them till later in the day ie 4 5pm, and the wait period was down to less than 10minutes.A very full day. We got there around 10.30 am and left when the street parade finished at around 9.15pm. Exhausting, but simply loved it "
5,"Had a great time at Disneyland. Great, but can be busy on Saturday and Sunday. Only point to note, is that the park opens at 10:00 but the first zone does not open until 10:30. I purchased priority tickets, if going at the weekend I would recommend priority tickets. Queues smaller during the week and not sure if priority needed."
4,"We had a terrific time at Disneyland HongKong   rides were fun, waiting times ok, shows were enjoyable, very clean, staff super friendly   only let down was average food but to be expected."
5,"Even though the rain set in for most of the day, as an adult we still had a fun time at Disneyland Hong Kong"
3,"Good to see while here, but very small. Great if we brought the children, but not for adults who have been to other ones. Not exciting for bigger children either."
5,"I love Disney, I even worked at Disney World in college so when we came to Hong Kong I knew we had to visit. I didn't visit the one in Paris when I went and I regret it. Hong Kong Disneyland is the smallest of the Disney Parks. We were able to ride all the rides in 3 hours when we first arrived at 9:30 a.m. I loved the Wondrous Book of Mickey and the Mystic Manor ride. I also liked the new Ant Man and Wasp ride b c it's like the Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger's ride in Orlando. I also liked how all the characters were dressed up for Easter and the Easter decorations they had up as well. I loved both parades, the afternoon and the night time one reminded me of the Electro Magic Parade that was in Orlando. If you're a Disney fan then you must visit Hong Kong Disneyland!"
5,"Small disneyland catering to kids, but they have some nice rides including the new Ant Man ride. Pricey food and somewhat long queues but that is part of the theme park. Try to go in the morning and then again in the evening, best is to stay one day at the hotel to maximize the park."
4,"It was very essay to go from the city to Disney central Station. We bought tickets on sight with the additional VIP Status so that we didn't have to line up.It was a week day and the park was not full  it was heaven. My only downside to the experience was that the main castle that appears on all their publicity was under reparation and it was very hard to find a restaurant with a variation of vegetarian food unless you liked pop corn, corn on the cob or a vegie burger in one of their fast food outlets. We really enjoyed our selves and so will you. Mind you I am 50 and my friend is 30 something...so it works for adults as well."
5,Awesome attractions that blew my mind away. The attraction is filled with amazing rides and entertainment. There are also halal food that definitely cater to my needs. Glad to be able to meet Mickey and friends.
5,Great fun for the family.  The fact that it is a smaller park than other Disney   s is a plus.  Facilities seem new and loads of different games.
5,Love this place very clean and safe have it own MRT to get here !!! Night time is beautiful too many things to do
3,"The Hong Kong Disneyland is quite small, there are too many people and the waiting line is long. it took average one hour or more in the line. however, the transit Disneyland tram is very nice, very impressive!"
4,"I visited here with my parents and 2 teenage sisters, we had a really fun day! The food offerings were good (albeit expensive). It was incredibly busy, but I think all Disneyland's are! Very easy to get to from Central Hong Kong. I think my highlight was the gift shop which was huge!! I would definitely recommend for a family day out."
3,It was ok. This Disney is more catered for smaller children rather than adults. Some of the areas were closed. There was only one really thrilling ride. the rest are for children. Maybe needs a few more western restaurants as well.
5,Went for day xx brilliant food x was holiday day for local people so very busy buy so polite .. had a great time
5,"I would recommend to go through below tips to navigate easily and manage most of your time at this marvellous amusement park.We visited during new year with 2 year old infant so some points could be helpful for fellow travellers.Tip: 1. dont take big luggage or even trolley bag while entering as they wont let you inside plus you have to PAY to use thier storage service also..only BACKPACK (read not too big) is allowed.2. Book online from klook app to get discount. This only saves time as on spot booking as long que.3. Always reach disneyland by its special metro train as its interior is superb and gives you great feel.4. Take map or use free wifi to access their app for show timings and ride schedule.5. Do not miss any of the live shows as they are worth watching and direction is highly creative.6. Always ask from disneyland employees at ride entrance exit for stickers as they usually keep and gives it for free as soveniour, even when you leav door person can also give you some JUST REMEMBER TO ASK POLITELY.Rest this is worth visiting and whatever age group you belong you cannot miss DISNEYLAND LA LA LAND!!!"
5,"A very small Disney and the castle was being worked on but overall had an amazing time. Was able to ride all the rides we wanted to ride. Very nice staff, lovely experience."
3,"Way smaller then the others and staff did not interact with kids as much as every other then park around the world. Signs to go where hard to read.. Arrows pointing in random direction, son is autistic so got told to take him around to priority que but who knows where that was.. Not many ques. Which was a bonus. Toilets plentiful and clean. Good shading and plenty of seats. "
5,Superb atmosphere in HK Disneyland. Must enter the park by 8am soon it   s opened and have more than enough things to do until dawn. Better check which amusements are under renovation as usually it has 1 or 2 parks under construction everyday. If this is your last item in HK tour you can check in luggage at Kowloon station and visit Disneyland. But recommend to reserve two day ticket if you want to try out all excursions. Fantastic creation and life time snaps to capture in 48 hours.
5,"You will love this place for the fun, food and the nostalgia it creates! Even when you are not a great mickey fan, you have enough avenues to enjoy.   Its not just for kids; even adults enjoy this."
5,Just so friendly.  Lovely food.  It was Halloween time and we had a great time.  It was good that y on could see everything in in one day.
4,The hotel is clean and tidy . The environment is nice . Staff in this hotel is very nice and effective . Swimming pool is good for children . A good resort feeling hotel and a lot of activities for children to play . Better to provide the photo taking for the hotel guest with Disney Explorers Micky as a souvenirs with the Explorer bathrobe .
4,My son and his wife and three children recently visited Disney HK. They had a great time exploring it and said there were virtually no lines!!The one fault they found was in the food. Children   s food was very lacking in variety and taste. Our grandson who must be gluten free had no selections on the children   s menu that he could eat. They had to purchase a $60 steak that was not the best either. They have frequented Disney in the US and it is very conscious of allergies and gluten free menu items are readily available. I would implore the Hong Kong ownership of this American icon to be more sensitive to these needs and make some much needed improvements to their menus.
5,Took some family to park for their first time at a Disney park. They loved it and it was a joy to see the kid in their eyes as they enjoyed all that it had to offer. Weather was great as well.
5,"My first ever Disneyland, couldnt ask for more. Rides were good, shows were good, performers were all excellent! Rides more towards kids friendly. But theres a couple of adult rides. Overall a great experience."
4,"During a recent stop over in Hong Kong we paid a return trip to Disney. We chose a day when the park was quiet so our longest wait was 30 minutes I am sure this is not the case at other times.Unfortunately some of the rides were being tested or being upgraded. To prevent disappointment check out closures before you go.We didn   t eat in the park as previous experience of it   s restaurant were disappointing and very expensive.This was our third visit to the park, whenever we visit Hong Kong a visit to Disney is a must."
4,We had an impromptu trip to Disneyland on a weekday. I love the trip because there is no wait time or at least 15minutes wait time for the rides. Limited restaurants though because maybe it   s a weekday? The bad part though is that the castle is under renovation and there are on going construction in the park. 
5,this is a wonderful place to bring your kids of all ages!!!it was very well kept and clean!! alot of rides for young kids...amzaing staffs around!there were halal foods which was wonderful!! it was fantastic at night and the light parade was fantabulous!!!Its a MUST GO for parents with young kids!!
5,"Who wouldn   t enjoy Disneyland? Hong Kong Disneyland is really easy to access. They have special metro to Disneyland and special designed. You better get there before 10 and directly queue until the parks open (at 10), so once it open you can enjoy many rides without long queue. Just be there on weekdays, avoid weekends!For muslim traveler, you shouldn   t be worry since you can find halal restaurant inside called Tahitian Terrace. It is located close to Tarzan   s Treehouse. The price ranges from 120 150 HKD if i   m not mistaken. I enjoy big rides but avoid big thrill drop. I   ve tried almost all rides except Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. Shame, i   m afraid of fast backward drop lol. So far I enjoyed Ant Man and The Wasp: Nano Battle, Hyperspace Mountain, Mystic Manor, and Mickey   s Phillarmagic!"
4,"It's my second time here but it's my daughter's first time in HK disneyland.Staff were nice but we weren't given much priority despite being 7mos pregnant. Overall, the theme park is still nice however, the comfort rooms were not well maintained.Shocked to find that regular malls and even Ocean Park provide toilet cleaner liquid dispenser in every cubicle and Disneyland has none! Maybe it's time to upgrade it as well."
5,"Although this is apparently a small Disneyland, I loved it. Being from NZ, it was the first Disney I had been to and everything was amazing. The shows, the rides, the attention to detail. Highly recommend it, although you really only need one day. never queued for longer than 10 mins on a Tuesday in March."
5,"We bought a package through the Disney website. We started at the Explorers lodge and the package included several priority passes (like fast passes). We actually never needed to use them because the longest wait time for a ride was 10 minutes. All of the shows and rides are in English and most cast members speak English really well. This park is the smallest of Disneyland parks in the world, but we still felt like there was enough to keep us busy for our day and a half that we were there. The bus shuttles were very clean and ran on time.Would definitely go again next time we are in Hong Kong."
4,"great way to spend a day in Hong kong as a tourist, easy to wander through the park and lots of fun, overall good value, found some good souvenirs along the way..food a little expensive as is with most parks a should do if your over that way"
2,"I went to HK Disneyland on 5 April which happens to be Qing Ming festival and did not expect the massive crowds on that day. Queues for rides and F&B outlets were very long and we did not have a great experience especially with a young kid. For the amount spent on the tickets, it's really a waste of money as we only sat on a few rides. I'm wondering if the park has any cap on the number of guests in the park as we had a hard time finding seats around. I booked my tickets via the Disneyland Hotel online but there was no info or confirmation given to me whether my park tickets are booked. In the end, I was unable to enter and had to buy tickets on the spot. Luckily, one of the cast members, Carmen, helped us to resolve the issue and let us access without queuing up again. Also the balloons there are overrpriced   HK150 for a helium balloon."
5,We have been to LA and Florida Disney MANY times so we were told we would be disappointed with this one. Not at all! We loved it. It had different rides and shows while still having the same layout and Disney feel. It is expanding a whole lot at the moment. My suggestion would be to add more food restaurants as the food lines were as long as the ride liens. We purchased online tickets and bought a partial ride upgrade. We wanted the full ride upgrade but it was sold out for the day. IMHO it is well worth it! We spent opening to closing there and loved it. The midway games were fun
5,"already went the for 4th times and it will never enough. It was a truly magical experience. Even though it is a small park but full of excitement. The parades, the rides, the characters and cast members all blend to make a great day with the kids. Going there by MTR was so easy."
5,"My wife and I brought 2 daughers in law to Hong Kong Disney recently. It has been more than 5 years since our last visit to Disney. Many new attractions have been added and we enjoyed very much during the visit. Our favourite ride is the Mountain Runaway Mine Car even with our age ranging from 12 to 59. In fact, we played 4 times all together and if time allowed, we would play more ! Take the ride disregarding your age when you visit Hong Kong Disney and have fun."
3,We had a local family member to take us round and he knew all the tricks to get around but the park is so super busy with so many queues. Kids enjoyed. I think evening is way better as easier to get on rides without queues! Avoid weekends and local holidays! The lion king show was fabulous! 
5,Definitely a fun place to visit whilst in Honkers. We had loads of fun there and would recommend a visit
5,"Everyone loves Disneyland !!! If you are traveling with young kids I would really recommend staying at one of the three Disney hotels. The hotels provide coaches, thereby making it more convinient. We stayed at the Disney hotel for two nights, the high point being the visit by the Disney characters at breakfast .  We also took a two day pass, it made the whole experience more relaxed and easy going.  Vegetarian food is only available at one of the restaurants. But the taste and quantity is good.  The park itself is well designed. There are enough options to engage very young kids to older kids.  The parade is not to be missed, as well as the different photo opps with all the Disney characters.  Other than the rides my kids really enjoyed the opportunity to dress up as young Jedi   s n fight the evil forces . A great family vacation. "
5,"This was a true highlight of our trip, they suspend reality so well in the park each lands attention to detail is incredible in decor, the sounds   smells, the staffs costumes and personas. There is truly something for everyone of all ages. The lines where very well managed with even on opening day of the new marvel ride just around 40 mins wait. Make sure you use smart fast track passes where you can they are free at some rides.It   s fair to say this park is much smaller than the others but somehow in that it becomes so much more charming.The staff could not do more for people bending over backwards they clearly love their jobs. They just seemed to intuitively just know what people needed.Would strongly recommend anyone with a day or two to spare. The current two day ticket offer was great for us as we did most of the flagship rides day one and the show and on the second day the other items.With this very close proximity to the airport and cheap bag storage it   s an ideal place to stop over or visit on your last day like we did heading straight to the airport after. "
4,"We've been here quite a few times and one of the better Disney's as queues are short and small enough to see everything in a day.We went mid week so was lot quieter and bought our tickets through Klook which was easy, but many of the rides attractions were under refurbishment and around 50% of the restaurants were closed (presumably due to less people). Price stays the same though! So you may want to double check in advance if you really want to experience any that might be closed to avoid disappointment."
5,Bucket list unlock.      One of the best trip we ever haven. Enjoy every single second inside Disneyland must to try every rides of it.
5,Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely a must see. It is a smaller park but what it loses in size it makes up for in quality. Hong Kong is currently home to the only Marvel themed rides and they do not disappoint. Hong Kong has many of the standard rides shows you expect from Disney but it also maintains a variety of exclusives. Hong Kong also has a lot of exclusive merchandise especially pins. Also most if not all of the rides are Bilingual. 
5,"Buy your discounted tickets on Klook (thus no ticket queueing when you arrive), get the MTR to Disneyland (35 mins from Hong Kong station where we had breaky at the Pret A Manger in the shopping mall there.). Take in lots of water as it   s expensive in the park. We also took in kids food and snacks as they are expensive and not great quality, you get searched on entry by if you have a good bag with many compartments, it   s easy to hide! Get there at 1015am latest and when the gates open at 1030am go straight for the Star Wars or ToyStory area. Only 2 or 3 rides have the fast pass, if you want to go to the Winnie the Pooh, use it there as the queue was long. Toy story land was great and big queues for the green parachute ride, so that   s one to go to first if you don   t start with Star Wars. The 245pm street show was very good (no need to get there early) but we were disappointed not to see the lion king show that is not currently on (download the free Disney HK App   will tell you what   s happening when). The Lion King show is a not to miss apparently and you have to get there before the street show ends or you might not get in. Recommend the musical show in the big Theatre, that   s next to the Small world. Saw the 1230pm show with lots of singing and Mickey Mouse and goofy !Our highlight of the day though was Mine train  amazing. Went on it 5 times.All in all, a good long day out   too tired to stay for the 730pm lights show !"
5,"Despite being one of the smaller parks of the company, two days are really worth while with a five year old and a baby. It is most relaxing as you will find enough time to enjoy. The transfer with the metro and the disney line works like a charme, all super clear signposted. Truly a fun day out with the kids. "
4,This was our first family trip to Disney as a family (hubby and I have been to LA before we had kids). We left the hotel at 8.30 am even though the park didn   t open until 10.30. I   m glad we did as it took a little while to get there and get tickets etc. We bought the Priority line pass for an extra HKD$299 but it was a big waste of money as the park wasn   t busy and we only had to wait once for a ride. As the park wasn   t busy there were many food shops that were not open. Our kids (13 and 10) loved the rides and went of a few of them several times. My 10 year old cried when we were leaving as she didn   t want to go   so she must of had a good day! It was long and our feet hurt by the end of the day because of all the walking but it was definitely worth it to see the kids having such a good time. We don   t AUD$670 on 4 tickets including priority line passes. 
5,This is the 10th time to Hong Kong Disneyland. I'll always recommend going on a weekday as on the weekends everybody goes with their children and the queues are doubled. The castle and other attractions were shut but they always inform guests on their website. The staff are nice and speak English so there's no need to be intimidated by that.
2,"Didn   t feel the Disney spirit in this place. There were few Disney characters around, but one must wait in long lineup to shake hand with them. We stayed for only couple hours and left."
5,"Fantastic  Nice place and kids friendly  Easly to get food in that area.   Better buy ticket from online, traveloka i guest  Because we can save our time before come to this place. Near from bus station and MTR station"
5,"What is there not to love about Disneyland? The attraction is well run, well worth a visit and a fun day out for all ages. The park is easily accessible from Hong Kong central by train and highly recommend the street parade and staying to see the park light up at night."
4,Friendly staff and cooling weather! Used Klook to purchase discounted tickets and scan QR code to enter was easy and fast. Enjoyed the time with my kids
4,"Smallest Disneyland and spent a day here. Having just gone to Tokyo Disneyland in February and comparing with this one in Hong Kong, I would say that this is a smaller theme park. However, they have packed quite a lot of activities and rides into a smaller area so there are still a lot to do for a day. In fact, Hong Kong Disneyland is newer and has more updated areas such as Iron Man and the upcoming Ant Man. Not very crowded when we were there during a week day but there are still short queues for the rides.The parades during the day and night were similar with most Disneyland but shorter and not as many floats. Went for the Mickey show as well as Lion King shows and they were enjoyable."
4,"I'm a big Disney park fan and a regular visitor to Disneyland Paris, so I was very excited to visit a new Disney park. We had a great time here, but compared to Paris, Tokyo and Florida (the others I've visited) it was very small with a limited number of rides and no real thrill rides. Space Mountain was very tame compared to all other versions.I'm serious about my Disney parks but struggled to fill two days here   I'd recommend only visiting for one day.The highlight was the shows   the Lion King show and the Wondrous Book were the best quality shows I've seen in any Disney park. The staging, live singing and performances were all very impressive.The food options are also really good with lots of variety."
3,"It   s a very huge game cum theme park, so if you are travelling with cute little ones make sure you have enough things to eat and drink. Although lot of restaurants and eateries are there but most of them are occupied in peak hours. It is an evolving theme park with addition of new games every year I liked the stark area in sci fi zone. I waited till 8 pm and witnessed the Disney   s signature parade too. Please expect waiting time of 20 30 mins for each ride."
1,"The main attractions were shut while we still paid the full entrance fees, without any intimation either online or as the ticket kiosks"
4,While it's not as great other Disney properties. This park as all the fun rides and attractions to give you the Disney fix. Mystic Manor is a great unique ride that plays the part of the SEA story that Disney is trying to tell. Overall it's fun to go visit when the crowds are low. Be sure to check your timing before booking your visit.
4,"We made it to Honk Kong Disney on the MTR and it was easy, quick and pretty convenient. We purchased our tickets onsite and used the online 10% discount for foreign travelers just by showing the web page and our drivers licenses. Much easier than buying online. I downloaded the app and it was great as a map and to track wait times for the rides. Most rides had 5 to 40 min waits. I recommend getting the fast pass for Dumbo as it was the only line that took MUCH longer than the advertised wait time. We were able to get on all the rides and still make it back on the MTR at a decent time but the train was pretty packed. Overall a very manageable and enjoyable Disney experience in a day."
5,"Even though it is smaller, there is great rides and and wonderful atmosphere. The paint the night parade is a must. Hard to find good lunch food choices but didn't matter. Great shops. Longest ride line was 20 minutes. 4 year old daughter did princess makeover and that was super cute. Ask all staff members for stickers, they generally have different ones in their pockets. We did 2 days and could have easily done a 3rd."
5,"We tried to buy our tickets online the day before but after entering payment details it said try later. We tried with a different card and it still gave the same message. The credit card company said the payment was taken but we had not received a booking confirmation. We took a taxi from TST area and it was not expensive and in an air conditioned car it was a pleasant journey. We arrived about 10:30. The next day at the park we had to waste time at guest relations where we were told the payments had not been taken, so we bought our tickets at the park. We will need to check our card statements to ensure no payments have been taken!We did not know if we should add the priority pass to our tickets as there was no information on how long the queues were at the entrance, unlike parks we have visited in the US, so we purchased them.Whilst at The Iron Man ride the priority cards were scanned on entry then scanned again before getting on. This is where two of the priority rides were recorded as used but it should only have been recorded as once   we did not know this at the time. When we tried to use our priority pass for the 3rd time later we were told we had none left. This was very embarrassing in front of the other park Guests. We said it could have occurred at Iron Man as they scanned it twice and was told to go back to Iron Man! We were tired by this point from going around the park and did not want to walk back there and so said we would go to Guest Relations instead. Guest Relations were not apologetic. We were offered the priority ticket for our next visit but we are from the UK and do not expect to return! We were offered a soft drink or popcorn   whoopy dah! We had just had lunch   no thank you. So we left with it not being resolved to our satisfaction.Please be careful if you buy online and if you have purchased a priority pass!The queues were about 15 30 minutes.We did have a great time at Disney but the pre purchase and priority pass experiences have left us feeling dissatisfied rather than elated and we still need to check payments had not been taken, so our negative Disney experience continues, even once back in the UK for the next few weeks."
5,Went to HK Disneyland via the MTR ( easy to get there and back) early March. Most days before were light showers but not cold. Our day was no rain :) and it took only 5 minutes to get onto the rides we wanted. Wife had never done a disney trip before and got some good shots with the Characters. She thoroughly enjoyed the Main Street parade and when we left the train was 2 minutes walk which was easy to get to our hotel.
5,Spent 2 days in Disneyland with my young children. Our 2nd time actually to the park. A must visit to everybody if ever you have the opportunity !
3,"We were disappointed with HK Disneyland. The train wasn't running and the Castle was under renovation, as were several other areas. It had an air of dilapidation. Our coach driver advised us to take food in, not in our bags, which would be searched, but in our pockets. The reason for this was that They want to make you pay the incredibly high prices for food they sell. He also suggested not buying souvenirs there, but taking a picture, then getting the item from Ali Baba (or Ali Express I suppose). A basic souvenir mug cost A$20 approx, and watches were about A$80. The parade though, was fantastic, and made up a lot for the rest of it. It's on twice a day, in the afternoon and evening. The fireworks that we'd previously seen there were suspended for a while, due to the renovations. An MTR station is right there at the gates   change at Central for other lines. There's also a ferry but it limits you to certain times of leaving, so MTR, taxi or bus is better. For a senior, HK$2 on the Oyster Seniors card gets you all the way back to a station close to your hotel, so don't bother with a tour. "
5,"It is my second time coming to HK Disneyland. Unlucky us, it rained. Haha! Although rain didnt stop us from enjoying. Its just sad that the afternoon parade was cancelled. But during the night when the weather cleared, HK Disneyland pushed through the Paint the Night Parade. It was my first time seeing it. 6 years ago there was only fireworks behind the castle (which is now still under renovation).My family and I will definitely go back. Love seeing my little one enjoying Disneyland. "
4,"HK disneyland was a great experience during Xmas, the celebrations and rides were great. People management was also top notch. Renovation of the main castle was undergoing when we went which was a disappointment so was the main night parade cancellation. We waited till the last moment but rains ruined it. Some refund or voucher would have been appreciated for cancelled show and castle renovation."
5,The start of the journey to reach Disneyland by MTR gives a fun ride with the train painted with disney characters. There is also a train within the Disneyland which helps you reach some attractions.
4,"I have been there 5 years ago with my wife..Now, i go there with my children..It's really nice to spend time with your kids in this theme park..Some problems:1. Castle is under renovation2. No fireworks3. Lion king under renovation4. Princess photo is limited only (no elsa of frozen is available for the photo session).. quite sad because she is my daughter's favorite princess..."
3,"Visited this theme park on 26.02.19. Overall, it was okay. Nothing spectacular. I have previously been to Disneyland Anaheim, Disney World Florida, Disneyland Paris, Tokyo Disneyland Disneysea. HK Disneyland is tiny, but fortunately not many crowds. The haunted house (mystic manor) was weird, though. I would expect something along the lines of other Disneyland parks, but yeah maybe it   s a cultural thing (nothing beats haunted house in Universal Studios Singapore during Halloween Horror Nights, fyi). Overall, my kids had fun there. Main reason why we went to Disneyland."
5,"I took my kids to Disneyland on weekday which was a great decision as there was minimum rush. very small queues. we reached there by 10 and started with Tomorrowland. we did all the rides by 5:30pm and left by 6:00 pm. Hyperspace mountain, grizzly mountain, jungle cruise, Mystic Manor and Iron man experience are a must do rides. better to buy tickets food combos from klook. you do not have to stand in queue. just scan barcode and enter. Also, most importantly, take your food coupons just after entry so that you do not ahve to return later to get the coupons. We went to Royal Banquet hall for food. average food. carry water bottle as water is expensive there."
4,We liked this compared with United States because its easier to navigate because its smaller and there are more rides for little ones. We went on Wed. and the line was short. Only from 5 minutes to 15 minutes wait. Unheard of in the USA. You can get here easily with MTR. Expect to spend a day here. They open at 10 am. The Moana show and the Disney Tale Story Show was our favorite.
5,"The monastery is really a beautiful place. The giant statues are truly awe inspiring, best seen on a clear day as the clouds can really limit visibility.  Great views from the tram up as well but Nong Ping is very commercial."
4,"We had a fun day here, it was quite busy and wait times were roughly 20   30 minutes per ride. Plenty of eating places and souvenir shops available. There were a couple of good rollercoaster rides, but nothing like Disneyland in USA. I would still recommend it for a good day out."
4,"Optimal size to try most rides in one day, if queue is less than 30 minutes. I wish there were more affordable gifts in shops and food and beverages."
4,"Tickets were cheaper than other Disneys. Fast Pass was the bomb as we pre bought. The best rides were Mansion and the Grizzly Man Coaster. Space Mountain is not as good as Florida, California and even Paris. Ironman is okay. Pooh bear is good. This park is way smaller than the others which keeps the day simple. You only need one day here."
3,"Having been to Florida, Anaheim and Euro Disney, Hong Kong Disney is definately the smallest, however given 5 hours to a day of spare time we think it is worth a visit. Limited number of rides but still fully professionally set up in true Disney style. The shows equally up to Disney standard. "
5,"Without a doubt, a true Disney experience.The parades, the rides, the characters and cast members all blend to make a great day with the kids.The journey is not long, and the MtR takes you literally to the front gate, so it is convenient for strollers.They will allow you to enter with baby food, as there are not many healthy options inside.With the classics like Small World, the park train, Main St. and the Castle you will not lack any of the    magical    feel.Make sure to have your tickets before as the line can be tedious in the morning, so don   t waste any time at the ticket counter"
5,"I've seen many negative posts and comments on HK Disneyland in the past. It is really not that bad. Yes, it is expensive and small but it has tons of rides for all ages.As an HK resident, I always go to Hk Disneyland and the experience is the same every time. Whether it is the parade or the rides, the park is incredible. There has been tons of revamps in the past few years with the farewells to Autopia and Buzz Lightyear Astroblasters but has been replaced with a brand new section in Tomorrowland featuring Iron Man and Ant Man coming in April as well as a brand new revamp of Space Mountain. The staff are extremely helpful and the gift shops have loads of merchandise and souvenirs. The park is also extremely kid friendly. The only negative I can extract from this park is the food price. The food isn't that bad but for it's quality, it is way too expensive. Since visitors aren't allowed to bring food in, you might have to starve for a day or buy an expensive meal.If you have lots of free time in HK and want something enjoyable whether with the kids or with your mates, HK Disney is a great park although if you are a major thrill seeker, Ocean Park would be more suited for you."
2,"Very very small, disappointing all along the line... the park is too small, without big attractions. In 3 hours you will have seen everything. There was construction with a lot of noise during our visit. It was ridiculous to visit the enchanted forest when you heard a jackhammer!! The maneges are limited. The prices are high for the quality of the park. It is better to keep your money and invest it in another activity "
5,"The place is no less..It is Disneyland :)My kid had amazing fun and the place is massive.It is such a wonderful place to visit when your kid is old enough to qualify all rides.My boy is 112 Cms and pretty much qualified every single ride.I loved adventure land personally as it is involved tree houses,boat rides etc...Mystic Mansion was out of the world..soooo digital and so well done..Eating options for Veg folks are very very very limited.Asked around inside the park about...veg food and people kinda looked at us weird..lol..Vegie Burger was the best we could get at 98$...Was not great but DLand compensated for the non food part..You could have ice creams at 45 HKD and pop corn at the same price.I liked the HK Tea in packed form.it was good.Bus from Disneyland R8 to Lantau costs around 6 HKD(very inexpensive) and i stayed at TST(Tsim Sha Tsui).From Lantau toll toook A21 to go to TST Prat Avenue.Costs around 28 HKD per Adult and around 20 HKD per child below 11.If you take a taxi from Dinsey to TST,considering decent traffic,it would set you off by 205 HKD one way.Peak traffic could cost you around 250 HKD to 275 HKD.Disney is a must visit and we took 2 days to do it as queue(s) are long and minimum it took us 45 mins of queuing to get to any attractions.Infants and toddlers,cap is mandatory and be ready to buckle up and stand the long queue(s),unless you have a priority pass."
5,I really loved Disneyland! The two must rides are the Mystic Manor and the Grizzly Gulch Runaway Mine Trains. Both are excellent. Highly recommend going on a weekday. We did not have a wait longer than 20 minutes any where on a Monday and Tuesday. You don't need the Priority Special or Priority Special   on weekdays.
4,"Came here 1 day after Chinese New Year, it was very crowded, try googling for the best time to visit the Disneyland. They had a few big parades around the theme park at certain hours, the last one was at 2000 hrs. To avoid rushing back with other visitors, I tried staying back after the last parade and got on the MTR after most of the visitors had left.The theme park provide strollers for rent, be careful not to lose the deposit slip or they wouldn't cash your deposit when you return the strollers.My kids enjoyed every parade especially the last one at 2000 hrs, with all the lightworks and Disney characters out on the street."
4,"An Amusement Park for all ages. Disneyland is for children and a adult that are young at heart. Its a place that you will enjoy. The best time to visit is March were the weather was good, that you will enjoy roaming around."
5,"This is my first time going to Disneyland Hong Kong. Unfortunately the Cinderella castle is being renovated and firework show being canceled. Shows such as Mickey and the Wondrous Book or Lion King are amazing. The parade in the afternoon is also good because we can see all Disney cartoon characters coming out. I love big grizzly mountain runaway because it was thrilling. I recommend you to buy popcorn which sold at stand throughout Disneyland, it tastes good."
3,"In HK now crowds are the norm, and Disneyland is no exception. It was a weekday but was still very crowded, I hate to think what its like on the weekend.Some areas were unavailable due to remodeling works, which was sad, but some new areas had been opened since our last visit and these were quite good.There are lots of rides for  children  of all ages, so enjoy yourself and have a good day.Buy your ticket before you arrive, saves time and some queues, and many times they are cheaper than at the gate.Easily accessible by the MRT from all over HK. Its not the biggest Disneyland in the world, but it made our little one smile all day."
5,"We went here w my family by invitation. Coming to Disneyland brings the child in you scream and enjoy fun times especially if you have kids w you in the trip. As usual, even on a Mondays, the queing for the long lines of activities will leave you to make ceratin choice events, rides, etc. We did get a roller coaster ride on Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain, photos taken w the Iron Man who was strutting around for poses w us, parades, store buys, etc. But what made the stay most memorable was the live presentation of Lion King musical wc made the final cut of our 'one day' experience @ Disney memorable!"
4,"Nice and cute small Disney. Attractions do slowly expand, but most are just fun rollercoasters for family. Many smaller rides to enjoy with small kids. Bring your water bottle, drinks and food are expensive, not many choices. Jedi show is a must for younger ones, besides are the eateries worth going to."
4,Not a very best disneyland but it   s still makes you happy to play there. Disneyland rides not as extreme as universal atudio because this build for all ages. Just enjoy your time and play!
4,This is a smaller park than American Disneyland. My favourite part was the lion king show. It had great costumes acrobatics makeup and props. My grandson does not want to go to Theatre but changed his mind after this show. Staff were sometimes too busy talking to other staff to assist and sometimes abrupt. Overall though we had a great time. I think American Disneyland set a huge standard that was hard to match. 
5,Amazing  The shows  Everything was amazing  If u are a Disney fan you should visit   Is in fact a must and if u didnt do it then ur missing out
5,"Relatively small compared to Disney World.  Well maintained, clean,  Admission fee the lowest  is $61  US dollars."
5,"I like shows.  Anaheim has no shows these days.  HK Disney is perfection.  My Chinese friend said,  I would be happy to sleep on that bathroom floor! "
4,"Came here once with my parents some years ago. Came here again for another visit. The rides are okay but as usual, super crowded and busy, especially the lunch hours where the queue can be as long as 45 mins to an hour. Food is so so, especially for the Starliner restaurant that serves western food. Ticket came with a food coupon for purchase of meal up to $149HK. Bought the recommended value set to maximise it but the burger was so pathetic, small, flat and the meat was half. "
4,Spent whole day and coming early avoiding crowds. It   s good to buy tickets ahead and avoid public holidays. Weekend could be tough but week days better. Accessible by metro . You are in hot commercial and consumer ares when they are not many things possible to resist. Enjoy the artificial words and attraction. 
5,"My husband and I love Disney and have visited quite a few of them. Hong Kong is a great park to visit! My favourite ride was the Mystic Manor   it has nothing to do with Disney, but a great little story which is a bit funny and has amazing detail in the ride. I believe it   s for HK only so really special. The run away train is quite deceiving, it starts of slow and you start to think it   s a bit rubbish...but it then surprises you. A winner with us. We got our tickets with Klook as this was by far the cheapest. It even came with the option for a meal deal which was did as it mean we didn   t have to worry about that. The food at Disney wasn   t great but ok. They are working on the castle at the moment and think it may take a while. At the moment it   s tiny! We found it so odd seeing the castle like this, but it   s because they didn   t have the money to build a bit castle. They do not so fireworks at the moment because of this but they are doing a light show at Main Street which was good. HK Disney has a toy story land, built before the one in Orlando. It   s really good but I love toy story. "
4,"We lived in FL & CA and have been to Disney World and Disneyland on many occasions. Although this one is far smaller than the others, we're glad we went. There is a special train that takes you there. There is an obsession with Duffy at the park. We went on a week day and entered when the park first opened. The only lines we encountered were for the characters. Easy to do in 1 day. Lots of great food options that is not your typical Disney fare. We quite enjoyed the time spent there."
3,"It   s our first Disney experience. And I think it   s a great location to start. Ppl said HK Disneyland is smaller than one is Tokyo (which it is). It helps us not feel overwhelmed.A ride for each ride is not too long. Maybe because it was raining on the day. We didn   t get to see many characters for the same reason.Unfortunately, the castle was under maintenance. So we didn   t get the full experience. But all in all, it was fun."
5,"It was incredible. We actually rode every attraction in the park, sometimes twice. Our longest wait   15 mins! We didn   t even use the Fast Pass or a Priority Pass. Compared to Disneyland in Anaheim, CA USA   If we had the opportunity; we would rather visit Hong Kong Disneyland. To save money, purchase your tickets and meals via the Klook app. (I do not have any relationship to Klook). Have Fun!"
2,"As my husband and I had a free day before we flew back home , decided to visit here, being that as we are over the age of 64 we got entry of just under   10 each depending on the currency rate. This park does not open until 10.30am, but we arrived earlier as we decided to buy our ticket on the gate rather than do this by phone. Surprisingly enough it was a very easy and quick process, just had to show our passportsWe got on the metro from Hong Kong to Sunny Bay station, crossed the platform to catch the Disneyland train which was only one stop.Seeing that this was a Monday the amount of people waiting for the park to open was massive, bug bear is that nearly everyone is on their phones and then you have to put up with them doing a 101 selfies. (please if you love yourself that much just get a mirror). Anyway the announcement was NOT TO RUN when they opened the gates, BUT WHAT did they all do RUN, no manners at all, push and shoved.This park is not a patch on the original Disney in Florida. There are very few rides and you can get round this park so quick. This is certainly not worth the   60 plus for adults .The atmosphere is certainly not here either, maybe because it was not very warm."
1,"Visited Disneyland Hong Kong today March 15, 2019. Poor experience. Very little there in the first place in terms of rides and other experiences. But most of it was closed for renovations (including the main Disney castle) or lots of stuff just not open anyway. Kids couldn't get pics with their fav characters as they kept disappearing for a break every 20 mins and queues were long already. All this missing and not even a reduction in the already expensive price. Pretty crappy day outSmall park, half open. Not worth the money."
5,Not a trip to HK without swinging by Disneyland. A day will never be enough to check out all the attractions. The place is huge and  seems to always have something every time we visit.
3,"It is a relatively small park, cannot be compared to the ones in Florida for sure! Worse off, we hit the park when the castle was closed for upgrade and no fireworks offered.Most of the park staff we came across were unfriendly and not very helpful with the odd exceptions! In fact they have  Smile  stickers at the entrance turnstile...it must be there to remind park staff since most of us visiting Disney parks have inherent great expectations!"
4,Disneyland is really for kids. The rides are way too short in time compared with counterpart rides in Universal Studios.  Kids would love the 'Mickey and the Wondrous Book' and Lion King shows!!!
4,"Spent a few hours at Hong Kong Disneyland. Easy to get to on the MTR. The queues weren't long on this day, which was fabulous. The castle is not open at this time, it's being updated. It's Disney, so of course, everything is pricey. The main street parade was really good."
5,"I would say that this place is really good, had so much fun with my friends. But, I'm little sad because one day is not enough to try all their activities and rides. A good place to get rid of all the stress.         "
4,"On my daughter's bucket list is to visit every Disney, so not going to Disneyland was not an option. If you are familar with the Disney's in the US, this one is much smaller. It had a few of the larger rides, the Star Wars rollar coaster, Big Thunder Mountain and Mystic Mansion which is their version of the Haunted Mansion. Otherwise, the park is very kid friendly. We did get there when it opened and we stayed until it closed   which was a bit too long for me, but my daughter loved it."
4,"A must visit when in Hong Kong. Great for kids and big kids also. It was my first time to Disneyland. We got the 2 day pass as the weather wasn   t to great. It rained half way on our first day. If the weather forecast is sunny, buy the 1 day pass as we could of done it in the one if the weather fine. "
5,The place was very huge!  There are many fun activities that you can do with your family or friends!  I would recommend you to go to this place if you have children as it is child friendly.
5,Disneyland is a perfect place to unwind and to be child again! I will always find a way to visit all disneyland all over the world!
5,"Magical, fun time at Disneyland. We had 2 wonderful days here. All staff make the visit extra special as they are so kind and patient.  Unfortunately we were disappointed to find the fireworks were cancelled both nights we were there. No warning or explanation."
3,"The rides are meant more for children except a few that are more thrilling. The decorations, however, were really detailed and brings out the Disney effect. It was nice to see that and really brings out the 'child' in me. Great atmosphere, great people! Overall, if you are going as a family with young children, you will definitely have a good time. However, if you are looking for thrill rides, better head to Ocean Park instead!"
5,"Last month,my parents,my friends and I went to Hong Kong.We arrived in Hong Kong on February tenth.The weather was cool and sunny.We went to the hotel first,it was clean and the service is good.Almost everything was perfect,the only drawback was the rooms of the hotel were too small that I didn't have enough place to play.After we had a rest ,we went out to a restaurant.The food it's delicious .we had beef balls,roasted goose,shrimp ravioli and some herbal tea.While we were eating,my dad and I saw a store selling iPads next store and since then I had a new iPad.That's really fantastic.We went Disneyland the day after we arrived.We played many recreational events.There were many people there.We waited for a long time to play it.The Roller Coaster was really cool.If there were not too many people,I really wanted to try that again.After we played for a day,every one was tired,we took a small train back to the hotel.We played the rugby,on last day in Hong Kong.It's very interesting.I tried some times and can played very well.I won a match and I was awarded two white caps and two rugby balls.We need to go home.The trip was great ! I really didn't want leave.I promised I will came back sooner or later."
4,"Firstly, it   s Disneyland. It   s the happiest place on earth, and it   s great.It is a small park, at least by Anaheim and Tokyo standards, and can be easily covered in a few hours. This leaves plenty of time for shopping and hitting the rides you like multiple times.We came on a Tuesday in early March and arrived at park open. The weather was nice out, but the lines were, thankfully, almost non existent. Even after the usual busy times of 1 2pm, most lines were less than 15 mins.We bought a priority pass, but in hindsight it wasn   t at all required. In the end we just used it to get the value, but we were really just skipping 5 minute queues, so it was a waste of money on this particular occasion. Perhaps we got lucky and other days would make it worth the money but I am unsure.The RC car and Grizzly were my favourite rides, both extremely thrilling.Disneyland HK is a must see if you   re here, but not the best Disneyland in my experience."
5,"My journey started and ended with this magical sentence. Although HK Disneyland is not the biggest Disneyland in the world, no. of attractions and rides are adequate for you to spend a whole day here. Hearing from the news that HK Disneyland is now expanding attractions, adding Frozen land and Marvel land. I believe HK Disneyland will attract countless people in the future. At the same time, it is hoped that the dinning place can be increased because many people finds no place to eat in the park."
4,"HK Disneyland is not the biggest or the best Disneyland, but I am grateful it is there. There are enough rides and attractions to make the trip worthwhile, and it is very easily accessible by the MTR Trains. Main disappointment Wes that there were no characters strolling thru the park to mingle with visitors. That may be because of overcast and potentially rainy skies. In any case, the weather also kept lines for rides very short   5 to 19 min max. No fast pass needed. I also like this Disneyland because you can still visit all the variety of parks paying one fee. In Orlando Florida, people have to buy a ticket for each of the four or five parks they want to visit, That gets really expensive. "
5,"The magic starts with the MTR, Mickey shapped windows and handle bars, then a five minute walk into the park with fountains and posters feels like you are already inside. Characters walking around everwhere, fun rides and friendly helpful staff. The parades are amazing . Oh and my kids had a good time too ... second time in 5 years and looking forward to visiting again soon."
2,Overcrowded with Chinese tourist who likes to take photos of cute young children without permission. The rides are fun but taking too long to queue. Food offering is good.
5,Smaller than the original but still just as much fun.  Fair way to travel but can be reached by train from HK Central.
5,"It's Disneyland, what more can I say?We went there on Monday. The crowd was big but we were still able to get on many rides:Jungle River Cruise,Slinky Dog Spin,Toy Soldier Parachute Drop,Mystic Manor,Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars,Mickey's Philharmagic,Hyperspace Mountain,IronMan Experience (without fast pass).Special mention about the Mystic Manor. It's said that it's only available in Hong Kong, no other Mystic Manor in any other Disneyland. So we had to go there! Although it wasn't a thrilling ride, it was still fun & very amusing for us. The MM souvenirs were also very cute. We spent quite amount of money there, because no other MM souvenirs at any other Disneyland shop (not even at the shop at the Hong Kong Airport!). So if you go there & find something you like, BUY it. Don't hesitate The only downsides were the Sleeping Beauty Castle & the Winnie the Pooh ride was closed for maintenance."
5,"We went as a family group to Hong Kong Disneyland and had a wonderful time. Our grandchildren just loved it, as did we all. It is good value for money, clean and well laid out. Highly recommended for a fun day out for children and adults."
5,"Easy to get there, only need to take the subway, inside the subway there is also disney decoration so can take pictures while heading there. Very convenience and clean. Inside the disney park, there are lots of cute sounveir shops, area is clean, people are friendly. Lots of disney characters to take pic with, not that long line up, it depends on the time and month you go. Although its not a big disney but you can still spend a whole day there. If you like cute stuff, hongkong disney is a must go. You will buy lots there."
5,"I'm working my way to all the Disney parks around the world. I've already hit Orlando, Anaheim and Paris, this is my fourth location (Tokyo in 2020 and Shanghai 2021). Although this park is slightly larger than Anaheim it doesn't really feel like it. They have fewer attractions crammed into a small space like the original. Overall the park is clean, themed well and all the cast members we came into contact with were pleasant. I don't think you can compare Disney parks to each other, it's just not fair. I like the HK version although a lot of the attractions were mirror images (or very close) to rides in other Disney parks. Although they are branching out with the Iron Man Experience (think Star Tours with Iron Man) and the new Ant Man and Wasp attraction (which was not yet open when we went in February 2019.) Mystic Manor is HK's answer to the Haunted Mansion. It has a compelling story with a character (Albert the monkey) that draws you in and it has great effects. HK DL is almost worth it just for this one attraction, we rode it twice. Although not as big as FL and not as detailed as Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely worth a visit."
2,"One of the group had been to Disneyland in Japan and wanted to go to this one.I had been told was the staff are very friendly, welcoming and peppy plus the mascots milling about and very fun. Don   t know if upwelling went on a bad day or something but it was not a great experience. With the exception of two staff none of them smiled or made you feel welcome. As to for the mascots, finally saw them at the end of our day and only in the    town    part.Costumes were ruined by staff wearing black running shoes. OK they are on their feet and need to be comfortable but it was seriously jarring. Staff get a 2 10.Things like the recycling bin being loaded and taken away to be emptied but not one put in to replace. Tables not being cleared.Two of the restaurants were shut, a number of the rides were closed, the castle was shut.At HK$620 it was not worth the money. I was told Disneyland HK was loosing money and I am not surprised.We went on a number of rides and they all had positives. Loved the Ironman ride, Starwars and the roller coaster in the Gulch."
4,"If this is your first disneyland, you will love it. I visited other disney land as well, i found this one smaller as compared to others. Though, it still will give you a delightful experience. The rides are lesser but there's lots to do. IF you come first thing in morning, you will be occupied for the whole day.The biggest attraction is the Parade and don't miss the last parade in night   feast for your eyes. My family and my kid enjoyed it thoroughly"
5,"HK Disney is the smallest of the Disney Parks and definitely something you can cover in a day. We contemplates doing a VIP tour as we had done in WDW, but left it too late to book and in the end glad that I didn't waste my money here as it just wasn't needed unless you were to go on one of the Chinese holidays.We stayed in HK central and took the train out which was easy to do with them running every few minutes, it really didn't matter if you missed one. Even the return at night despite all the people it was frequent enough that there was never a significant wait. The People are somewhat pushy though it's some form of FOMO(fear or missing out). The train doors open people push in and out. If you finish one ride it seems you need to run to the next one so you can get ahead of 2 people. Rope drop which would normally allow a flow of people into the park was more like the starting gun of the New York Marathon.That said, we loved the park. Favorite ride is Phantom Manor, similar type of ride to Ratatouille in France but with some magical effects. The light show at night is also worth staying to check out.As a tall person 6' 4  I did find myself having to contort myself into seats to fit my legs in. Same thing with Tokyo, but you can fit. I found crossing my legs and moving my feet as far back in the seat as I could before sitting down made a difference.The Lion King show was amazing so I would put that down as a must!"
3,"I   m a big Disney fan so was super excited to visit HK Disneyland. Although we had a fun day.. I can   t help but feel disappointed. The park was very small and I feel the price is extortionate when comparing it to Disneyland Paris   which is much larger and significantly cheaper. I found that it didn   t have the magic of Disney and it just felt like any old theme park. The staff were not particularly friendly and they didn   t engage with guests at all   in fact, I was ignored by a group of 3 staff members! Having said this.. mystic manor is quite possibly my new favourite Disney ride ever   you really have to go on it!! "
4,"It was always a dream to visit a Disneyland and it came to true when we visited HK Disneyland. You can easily reach thro MTR station and this is the most convenient mode. We went around the park, train ride, boat ride, tarzan house, magic 5D show, winnie phoo etc. Amazing to witness the main street parade. Huge food court available inside the premises. Overall it was a relaxing day out"
5,"We visited Hong Kong Disneyland as group of family on 1st January of 2019. We thought that the park will be packed since is the holiday season but luckily the park is moderately packed.My thought about this place is a great place to spend your day in your HK trip. The park is very nice and it was smaller than your typical Disney park. Compared to other Disney park I've ever visited, this theme park has shortest waiting time especially for thrill seeker attraction and of course no need to check all the fast pass.You can download the apps beforehand to check the schedule for the parade, map, and waiting time for each attraction. Unfortunately in our visit, the Sleeping Beauty castle is still under construction but we managed to enjoy Disney Christmas Celebration.In our visit, We managed to enjoy 6 rides, 1 parade, 2 shows in our 4 hours of visit. If You're a thrill seeker, don't forget to enjoy the two attractions exclusive in HK Disneyland, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars and Mystic Manor. For a magical time of great fun, you can   t go wrong with Hong Kong Disneyland!"
5,Great day out and it is so easy to do it in one day as it is so much smaller then other Disneyland around the world. Just be warned that currently the 8pm fireworks aren't on due to maintenance on the castle
4,"Disneyland never failed to amuse everyone  Excellent and friendly, park and attraction are great  Crews are great, speak english, and also nice hotels"
5,A great way to spend the day in Hong Kong. All the usual well run Disney facility's. Easy access to the venue we used the MTR all the way which was easy. Crowds were OK for mid week and winter. Cost HK619 for the day each adult. We ate in the explorers club restaurant and had an Asian curry which was OK although a bit bland to cater for all tastes. All in all e all had a fantastic day out. 
5,Awesome feeling and great experience. Really enjoyed a lot with family. Would love to visit the place again and again
3,This is the first time we visited Hong Kong Disneyland.. We decided to go to Disneyland during chinese new year holiday.. It was so crowded and not really enjoy the attraction..
4,Entering the HK Disneyland tend to bring back the child in you. While inside you'll forget your life's problems and if magically youre in a different world full of fun and fantasy. I love the rides but very few restaurants to choose from.
4,"I personally haven't gone to a Disneyland outside of California so I didnt know what to expect. The cultural ties to the Chinese culture that they implemented at the park was simply amazing. This is probably the only park where Mickey can speak Cantonese. The park is very clean, it was smaller than your typical Disney park. There are various shows you can watch throughout the park. The rides are similar to what you would find in California. I believe the Iron Man attraction might be unique to HK. The park was busy but not to the point where we had to wait hours for a ride. It averaged 30 minutes or so per ride. If you're looking to experience something different from Disney, this would be the place to go. We only went for the day and was able to go on everything we wanted to go on. Just keep in mind that this park is smaller. I would not recommend coming here during Chinese New Year or Golden Week."
4,"First time I've been to Disneyland, so I have no benchmark for comparison. Smaller than I expected, but big enough to fill a full day for two adults. Lots of fun to be had, though some of the rides are aimed at children, so don't be disappointed if you're too big to fit on them. The Disney train was very cool, and had a real air of excitement...Join Mickey and Minnie for the day and enjoy :)"
5,"I   ve visited every Disney park except Shanghai and this is perhaps my favorite for a toddler. It   s a close replica of the Anaheim Disneyland but smaller without some of the big kid rides. PROs:1) For a Disney park, it   s not very crowded. I love Tokyo Disney Sea but the crowds really kill the experience there. People in Hong Kong apparently do not wake up early even when the park opens at 930am. There   s really are no lines for the first couple hours. Even during the busiest hours, the lines are moderate. 2) I love the variety of foods from all different regions. I actually looked forward to meals. 3) When we were there, they were 6 different times for the Jedi training and it was never full. 4) Admission tickets are so much cheaper than any other Disney park in the world. You can use apps like Klook to buy discount tickets and discount meals. If your children are under 7, this really is the perfect Disney experience. "
3,There is some wonderful excitement built on the train ride to Disneyland with the cute Mickey themed carriage. We enjoyed Mickey waffles while there and the Lion King Show. Other than that the lines for rides were very long and I felt the experience was quite overrated. I MUCH preferred Ocean Park.
4,"Most of the staff members are friendly and accommodating. We were there on over chinese new year and the place was packed. The lines were a bit too long and a lot of people. During the parade, the Disney employees who were in charge to keep the crowd away from the floats were cranky and ill mannered. Disneyland is really a beautiful place. There were restaurants and food carts at every corner. The restrooms were all big and clean. The rides and attractions were enjoyable enough that you would want to see ride them again. "
5,It is a worth it experience. Enjoyed it together with my daughter and grandchildren's. Feels like young again.
5,"Magical as expected. Fairy tale! Some great themed rides, highlight for us was the Iron Man. Go for the slightly more expensive ticket that gets you priority pass, otherwise you will need to queue quite a bit."
4,"If you have a kid with you, you would have her or his eyes feast on all the attractions here. It isn't as big as Ocean park but it is good for those who have been wanting to see Micky Mouse in person. Sadly the time I was here is when the castle was renovated."
4,Very crowded most of the time and long queue for rides. Food limited choice and quite pricey.  Kids can collect stickers given out by staffs all over the place. Just need to approach the staffs for free stickers
5,As a family we have been to Disney Florida many times. HK Disney is smaller but still has all the charm of Disney Florida. My girls had a great day and even at the age og 16 would go back againn
5,Stayed in Disney   s Hollywood hotel and spent 3 days in Disney Hong Kong with our 3 year old daughter   She had an amazing time with all the characters and princesses  Park is smaller than Florida and California but well worth a visit
3,"Small Disneyland compared to Paris and the attractions are espcially for kids and only some of them for adults. We came here after the Typhoon so some attractions were closed. The price is a bit high for what you get. Overall we had a great time and it took us about half day to finish all the park. If you are looking for thrill attractions for adults, Ocean park is much more better!"
4,"I visited the Disney parks at LA as well as Florida but really impressed with Hong Kong Disneyland during the last visit. It was well connected, well organized, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. It's good for a full day visit but it needs some planning so that one must decide on what shows to watch and which fast passes to gather."
5,"It was a busy night at around 1900hrs at Royal Banquet Hall on Feb 20. Long queue for ordering food and most tables were occupied. However, there was a staff called Wilson. He was absolutely professional. He smiled all the time even when he was cleaning up all tables (non stop). It made us felt warm like home. Keep up your professional work and effort. Not many staff could smile like you. Beautiful smile. "
2,"So much of the park is closed!! Very disappointing   only a few rides In the park. I do know there is an expansion planned, but so much was closed now, I don't know how they can afford to expand! I knew it was a small park before we went, but it is lacking the 'Disney' in every aspect... other than the cost! It is really easy to get to on the MTR and good for about 3hrs of entertainment If you are looking for something different to do while visiting HK."
4,"Had a great day here.  Lines get long very quickly, so was glad we got there early and huge crowds.  They have terrific souvenir shops of which prices were not to bad and the food was very good, especially the caramel popcorn   amazing."
4,"this was a very interesting park because although it was very crowded, the line ups were never too bad... we went in with a plan because we only had one day... but we did enjoy ourselves. i suggest going shopping early in the day because the people there were savages! the store workers couldnt even keep up with people throwing things on the floor and all over the shelves... what a mess!! it was a terrible store experience and i waited 45 mins just to pay! the park was fun   the space mountian was fantastic but the shopping was awful so just know that going in   only need one day for this park"
4,"Such a lovely place that really took me back to my childhood. Although queue can get long and the fast pass is not logical, the displays are great! The rides are great! A few good food options! Parade was great! Fireworks great! Great shows! Really enjoyable and can spend the whole day here. It   s a small Disney Land but really lovely. "
5,"Fantastic experience. Enjoyed every step of our stay in this wonderful theme park. Thank you DisneyLand, Hongkong."
5,"No doubt people keep saying this is the happiest place on earth. To be honest, this place is quite far from the city, but don't worry you can reach here using MTR. I personally think the entry ticket is quite pricey, but it's all paid off with incredible attractions. It's truly magical! If you are family with kids, it's a must visit place, you can meet almost all Disney characters, and don't forget to capture your moments, there are so many beautiful photo spot to be captured. Suggestion: you'd better come in the morning, since the weather is not too hot and there will be more crowded in the afternoon. And if you are not in rush, be sure to see the parade or the fireworks show in the night (about 30 minutes before the closing time), that's really worth the wait, and I can say that's one of the best show I have ever seen."
4,We never had went Tokyo Disneyland or Shanghai Disneyland. Hong Kong Disneyland was our first Disneyland. It was not crowded so we can enjoy 4 hour stay.
5,"Much smaller than the US versions and you can easily cover the entire park in one full day. They have some things you can't find in the US, so, it was fun to see those.  The mystic manor and space mountain were my two favorites."
5,"Easy to get to using the MTR. Change at Sunny Bay station onto the shuttle service out to the Disneyland Resort. As you   d expect lots of Disney themed stuff going on, the train with Mickey shaped windows, hanging hand grips Mickey shaped, various statues of characters in the carafes. We went in February on a damp day. Not overly busy, with queue times between 0 and 10 minutes without any kind of priority boarding ticket. Having been to Disney Land Paris and Walt Disney World in Florida I was still hugely impressed and couldn   t stop smiling for the whole visit. A real mixture of East and West themes going on, similar in so many ways but different enough to make it still feel new. There was some building work going on around the castle and as a result the train wasn   t working though that didn   t detract from the day. Log in to the Disney Land Wi Fi and we got a HK$10 voucher. Thoroughly enjoyed Toy Story Land. The classic area of Tomorrow Land rebranded as Star Wars & Marvel. I was in Hong King as part of a short break celebrating my birthday and would thoroughly recommend taking the time to visit. You   re never too old for Disney!"
4,Each visit is just as magical as the last. My son always enjoys meeting the characters and the food that's shaped like Mickey. Would only recommend that they have other food options other than the exiting ones as variety for those that visit frequently
4,My kids love it. Lots of rides for children and adults. Food is good and lots of places to buy souveniors.
4,"The rides, views, and character actors were marvelous. I highly recommend the Lion King Festival (at least I think that   s the title of the show) as the music and dance is spectacular for anyone who enjoys enjoyed the movie. The night parade was a bit too crowded for my taste (I got slightly injured due to the immense number of people) but the parade was fun to watch. Getting on rides isn   t too difficult as the queues are usually only 20 30 min long.                                                                                                        .                                                                                ...                               (       3          )                          !    **   ,    **                                                                                                                  . "
5,It is definitely the happiest place on earth. Start off your day with a photo op with the balloons. Then make sure to have a photo pass you could get great photos taken by pros. You can opt to have your daughter be a princess for a day. If you are staying at the hotel it is just near the restaurant. Make sure to catch both the day and night parades.
5,Great place to visit if you are any age! Really clean and the workers do not allow line jumpers (which is good). It is a smaller park but this makes it easier to navigate and you don't have to keep going back to see thing you missed out on.
4,Went with 2yrs old and 5yrs old. 5yrs old had fun since he already know how to enjoy and knowing the characters. Crowded as usual as i went during a Sunday and its CNY period. Most rides are kids friendly.There's much more attractions compare to many years back during my first visit. Great for both kids & adults.
4,A wholesome place to take the kids. Only gripe was that the Its A Small World Ride was closed due to upgrading. Love the food that caters many cuisines both Asian and Western. Don   t miss the Light Saber churros : )
5,"Sure, after Anaheim, this park is small. But so much fun. We travelled with our 3 year old and it was perfect for him. We enjoyed 3 days in the park. You can't quite see everything in 1 day   2 is perfect and 3 just gave us the luxury of time to see everything with time to spare. We were blown away by the shows   Mickey and the Wonderous Book and The Lion King are incredible. Skip Moana if you are on a schedule. Rides aren't that thrilling, but definitely good fun. Disney has this amazing knack for making kids rides that are fun for adults too! Toy Story Land's parachute drop is the best!! Make sure you get there at rope drop to maximise your time in the park. Food is expensive, but good enough. Choose week days for low crowds   we were there 2nd week of Jan and crowds were good. Take the train (MTR)   it's part of the experience and easy to do with some planning. Saved money by buying tickets on klook   easy to use. Often can get a discount vouchers for shops on main street between 10 and 10.30 while waiting for rope drop for rest of park. They can store your parcels and collect at end of day.Consider booking a character meal (e.g. breakfast at Disney hotel) to get those great character snaps  saves you needing to line up during that precious park time!"
4,"My friend and I ended our Hong Kong trip at Disneyland since we had a late flight out that evening. We checked out of our hotel (purchased tickets through our concierge which included the bus ride there). We dropped off our luggage right before the entrance to Disneyland for a reasonable fee there is a special place at Disney to hold your luggage for the day. Small Disneyland compared to Anaheim and Florida but definitely fun to see and experience. The food inside the park was disappointing. Overall, if you have time to see this after you have experienced the rest of Hong Kong, it's worth the time. MTR station right at the exit, easy to catch it and then catch the Airport Express."
4,"very nice place. i love it so much. very big and spacious. the rides are very modern, the parade of disneyland figures is also very beautiful and nice. unfortunately when i was there, the disney castle was under renovation so i couldn't see the fireworks show."
5,Everything are fun fun fun! But the food quality ahould be checked since uts really pricy and everyone are willing to pay
5,Great day out .....granddaughter had an absolute ball.  great main street parade and rides for the kids  as expected food n drink a tad expensive   Pleant of spots for us oldies to sit and relax
4,"Went to Disneyland with my family and indeed, it   s the place for small boys and girls but also for adults. It brings back fun memories of being a child. Place is a bit small compared to the other Disneyland. Also, a lot of renovations are going on. A bit disappointment was the parade of lights since not all characters were present during the parade. Felt like we were cheated.Over all, it   s nice to experienced and see the difference from the other Disneyland places."
5,"Back to your childhood life, this theme park are full of imagination. It   s very attractive. Spend the the whole day, from morning to the evening. You   ll never get boring here because it shows a lot of attractions. Don   t forget to see the fireworks as a closing ceremony. "
3,"Very small Disneyland compared to the other countries. Beautiful Disney themed train to reach the park. Big disappointment due to the Disney castle closed down and no fireworks, friendly staff and very helpful"
5,Visited on January 1st. Used MTR from Kowloon which was quick and easy 2 changes. Quirky Disney carriages on last one. Caught the 4pm parade   flights of fantasy and the 8pm Paint the Night parade also the 7pm we love Mickey projection show birthday edition. The magical twilight snowfall at 6:45 was fun to see. Some areas were closed for renovation but still plenty to see plenty of queues for the rides. Overall a great visit even for big kids.
4,"It was fun to go to HK Disneyland. We stayed at one of the Disney hotels and took the private bus there. We had pre purchased tickets   and be aware that there is a great senior discount!This was my first Disneyland in Asia, and my understanding is that Tokyo Disneyland is better. Disneyland HK is smaller than the two parks in the US. It was oddly similar, and yet oddly different. The park was clean. Small World was being refurbished when we were there, so we were not able to check it out. Some fun things to note:1. They have Star Wars chopsticks in the Star Wars shop! Wish I'd bought more. 2. We had Indian food for lunch, and it was spicy but good.3. They had the usual Disney signs with rules before you get on a ride, but I don't recall seeing  You should be sober  as part of the instructions in Anaheim or Orlando! Disneyland is out on Lantau Island. Although we had fun, I would probably spend my time doing other things next time. "
5,"Disneyland is what it is. It makes people happy, not only kids but also adults like me. The parade is something to watch out. Although my advice is be early and get priority passes, if budget permits, to enjoy your day. We have 4 passes and this made a great deal in our experience."
5,"Although this is the smallest Disneyland in the world, it doesn   t discount on the value. It definitely worth a visit!"
5,"Indeed a happiest place on earth! My kids enjoyed it a lot from my eldest (10years girl) ,6 years old boy, 4 years old boy and 1 year old girl. The light show, the parade are fantastic even the food!!!! Yum!"
4,We chose a Chinese National holiday to visit Disneyland so it was busy but as we were travelling with small kids we were too worried about going on a lot of rides. We had bought the meal deal tickets but found they weren   t good value as they limited our choices for lunch. The Moana show was great and the park was easily accessible for our 2 year old. 
4,"It is really one of the happiest place on earth. The ambiance of the themed park will make you feel young and free. As for sure, you will enjoy the rides. Sadly, when we went there the castle is under construction so the disneyland trip isn   t complete. "
4,"I've gone to both Disney parks in California and Orlando and while HK Disneyland is very small in comparison, I loved how this park won't have you exhausted by the end of the day and still allow for other activities after you've finished your time. This was how I scheduled my time with my friend. 11 am met a friend at Nam Cheong MTR and rode over to the Disneyland Line. A smart thing to do would be to buy your tickets on your phone as you are riding the MTR. (We didn't and wasted some time at the ticket gate)Once we were in we took our rounds of pictures. The first impression was,  Wow, that's the castle? How awful.  Though when I was there they blocked off the castle so they will be making a more robust castle soon from what I'm understanding.In other parks like Japan and the USA, it's all about looking for the snacks all around the park. (Here's looking at you Dole Whip) I need to get this out of the way, the food is awful at HK Disney. This fact really surprised me given that there's so much good food in HK but it really was pretty horrid. Friend and I had some bad lunch and then went along to other rides. Most rides were about a 20 minute wait which I thought was very acceptable. I think the longest wait we had was for Hyperspace Mountain and that was for 40 minutes.Checked out the parade and was actually hoping for Asian women dressed up as Cinderella or Snow White. Nope. God forbid Snow White is an Asian. But I suppose I get it. lolAfter some snack fails and a Philharmagic 3D show we exited the park at around 6 pm. Took the MTR straight to Tsim Sha Tsui for a nice dinner at 7 pm. At 9 pm, friends and I were parked at a whisky bar and then by 11:30 pm I was home in bed.It was one of the most amazing days because this type of Disney excursion never happens in either California or Florida simply give the scale of the parks and also how awful public transportation is in either cities.I wouldn't recommend coming to HK for Disneyland, that would be a let down. However, if you're sightseeing in HK and have time for Disney, it's a no brainer to go."
4,We were in Hong Kong in September. The park is smaller than the other three that we have previously visited but has all the expected rides and features. It was pretty quiet on the gay of our visit.
5,"Our 3 year old daughter loves all of the Disney princesses so we had to take her to Disneyland. She had an absolute blast and probably loved the parade best because she got to see all the princesses.Unbeknownst to us we were in Hong Kong the week leading up to Chinese New Year so the city was packed but it didn   t really affect our Disney trip in any way other than it was probably much busier for a Monday than it normally would be.Disneyland Hong Kong is now where near as big as the original or Disney World Orlando, we haven   t yet been to Paris or Tokyo Disney   s so we can   t compare to them. Even though the park isn   t as big as the two in America it   s not missing anything for our 3 year old but it would be lacking in rides and activities for older kids to teens. The classics are there such as It   s a Small World. All in all it was a great trip."
4,"We were lucky because the weather wasn't great when we went which meant it was quiet and we didn't wait for any rides. If you have been to any of the others you may be dissapointed but its still beautifully put together. The rides are small but still lots of fun. I would recommend it for an afternoon or morning, you don't need to spend a full day. "
3,"The place is nice, but, after i have visit in Paris and USA, this one its not that great.  it's feet more to little children.  The show at the evening was great.  I really waited to the  space mountain  but it was nice only."
5,"I have never been to any Disney Land and this was my first visit. I do not know who was more excited, my daughter or I !! The place was VERY crowded and everything was super expensive. Most of the rides were childish, but I did enjoy some. Queues were too long for some. What else to expect from such a popular destination? The evening parade was excellent!! Enjoyed myself thoroughly."
5,relive your childhood. Disney has everything that a child dreams of. so colourful vibrant and full of energy. great shows. great rides. and a nice theme park totally justifying the Disney brand
3,"This is just for kids only. Very small in comparison to Disneyland, in USA. Most of the animals were just toys; not real animals.  Anyhow a good start is made !!"
5,My daughter experienced being a princess for one whole day and this is a memory of a lifetime.  It is always a treat to visit Disneyland.
5,What a great opportunity to experience first hand the magic of Disney! After visiting other Disney parks it   s nice to visit a park with the same magic but with an Asian flair. With so many similar attractions like the ones in the US it a familiar time. 
5,"Hong Kong Disneyland isn   t as big as some of the other resorts but it has a lot packed in. The park is easy to navigate and there is always something to see or do. Character encounters take place at all times throughout the day and all over the park, often without a crazy lineup. The separate sections of the park are unique and well organized, and each gift shop as something a little different from the others. The Lion King show is amazing and very entertaining. A great place to spend a day or two if you   re in Hong Kong! "
2,I love Disneyland but I wouldn't recommend Hongkong Disneyland.The reasons are:1. The staffs in Hongkong Disneyland not good like Disneyland or disneysea tokyo. They're very rude n not polite. Difficult to speak in English.2. Better I went to Dufan Jakarta than Disneyland Hongkong. I heard staff shouting the people who lining the attraction.3. No smile from the Disneyland Hongkong staff.
1,"Every year I come to Disney with my children, every year is worse than the last one!!!!Prices for entrance tickets are outrageous, specially taking in account that the rides are minimal...Food prices are not normal, even for Disney, super hyper expensive, horrible food, even the junk food is tasteless!!!Only good thing about this place is leaving it!!!!"
2,"If you going for the Disneyland adventure this is not the place. The price to enter is ridiculously high and don   t bother with the skip line thing coz it   s just not worth it, if you get there early enough you will get to go on all the rides before lunch and then you have been on them all. The famous Disney castle was undergoing a renovation that was not indicated on their website or at the gate. From the drinks to food and all those stupid little shops everything is way overpriced. The photo below was taken at 11:00. "
5,"Visited with my 2 kids and Wife , we had so much Fun .we will be back for Sure.  Disneyland in Hong kong have so many activities to offer , we had great time with my family . I LOVE HONG KONG"
4,Hong Kong Disneyland is the smallest of the Disney parks and not as crowded as Japan. They have the new Ironman ride attraction but some of the old ones have been closed and being replaced.
5,It is a nice place. I like Mickey Mouse when I was a kid. It feels great when you meet the real cartoon characters. I spend a whole day and it feels refreshing and fun.
4,"Small park so u can finish in one day or maybe less.. Still interesting everytime i visit, its Disneyland in the end.."
3,"What we didn't like was the unhelpfulness of the staff. We had pre purchased meal vouchers which we lost soon after entering the park. When we went back to one of the stores to check if we dropped it there while paying for merchandise the store lady was very rude. She rudely asked bow do we know it's your even if we find it. I asked her how many other people have come looking for their food vouchers, she said none. I couldn't believe how crass these people were. We requested the reception to reprint the voucher since they had bar code and they refused saying they can't. This just shows how backward their technology is. It's not a big deal to reprint the same bar code. If someone had already used our voucher the bar code wouldn't work anyway so no harm in reprinting it.We were there during the Christmas holidays. It was crowded but well organised. Some of the places were closed since they are expanding. The parade was fun and so we're the ride especially star wars and the grizzly gulch."
4,"A concierge at the hotel found my phone that I had left in a taxi, and wouldn't accept a tip for this! They truly go above and beyond. The actual park isn't as great. They're very rigid with what seem like silly rules and the large amount of older teen early 20's girls with attitudes as their main attendees isn't great. Courtesy from other guests just doesn't happen here as it's all about the selfie."
5,"I bought ticket from KLOOK and easily access to disneyland entrance. Just print out document and present to staff at the entrance.Some bad things are about the present of each cartoon, I waited to take picture with Donald Duck and Daisy but they showed up only short time. Waste my time a lot. Woody at Toy Story showed himself only in the morning. I almost cried when staff told me that Woody will show again during parade time in the evening!Long queue to wait for each machine, wait around 40 minutes to 1 hour and can play only 5 minutes!!!!!Food in Disneyland is not really good, but no choice to eat."
5,"Though HK Disneyland is only a fraction of the typical size, all ages find its fun here! No one will dislike Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy.....First time use 2 day pass and still cannot complete all major attractions! A good reason to come again!"
3,"Always wanted to see Disneyland and when I had the chance, Christmas Eve 2018, I was disappointed. Maybe if I had been 7 and not nearly 70 I might have enjoyed it more. I expected to see a lot more characters and not be confronted by closed exhibits."
3,"Sorry to say but the most interesting part was probably the Disney themed train for the final leg of our journey, As seniors we thought that the day would be a leisurely one with plenty of rest stops. Not even close.The only postive was taking the    train    around the outskirts which told us there wasn   t much to see, less enjoy. Rides were for 10 12yo and under and their parents carers. Food drinks overpriced and not what an Aussie would consider half decent.Highlight was photo of    Thanks for visiting Disneyland   "
4,"What a day, you could easily spend more than one day. Heaps for the young, old and young at heart. If you dont like adrenaline rush rides there are plenty of other rides and sights to see. Long waiting period for the rides. Great parades and light shows at dusk are breath taking. A must to go, Be prepared for a long day. "
4,My daughter and I had a great day at Disney. We got there when it opened and did most of the rides at least once before it got busy. Would recommend getting fast passes for repeat rides and then enjoying other rides whilst waiting for your fast pass time. Food is expensive and not great. Overall a good day out   we had fun esp as it was Xmas and the decorations were nice. 
2," Too experience to visit ,for over $600 Hk , every things so crazy , waiting time for any ride well over one hours ! washroom is closed to one and half hours wait ,poor ladies 1,the foods is so pricey ever Micky would not buy it ,people ,people ,people ! it is a small kingdom with no local want to come ,no wonder they lost money every year ,better off save time and moneys do some things else ,you will thank me for it !"
3,After going to euro disney in paris and disney land its a bit disappointed to go to disney in hong kong. you will feel the disney vibes but it is very small and only 3 or 4 attractions for adults. for children it is great and they will enjoy int 
3,A tad disappointing after Paris Disney as it is small and has only a few fun rides. Most disappointing was the lack of variety in the retail therapy!!!! Sorry Disney but I   d go to Ocean Park next time.
5,"I love being in Disneyland! the ambiance, parade and everything was great! But the food taste there is so so."
4,Overall a small park compared to the other Disneyland. Definitely only need a day there. When we went in late April it was very hot and we ended up buying a umbrella which was brilliant for the day. Sadly the castle wasn't open when we were there and surrounded by wire fencing which made photos hard. Overall a splendid day and lines were not an issue at all the max we had to wait was 20 mins
1,"I'm writing an honest and truthful opinion of this park. I'm not paid by anybody to discredit Disney. If you in HK, do not go to this rip off expensive overpriced park, which is not even worth HK$10 let alone paying over HK$400. There's no attraction, the rides are garbage, no decent food court and the price of the food is three to four time the price. this theme park is just as big as the Victoria Park in HK.Those who are commenting about how wonderful the time they had must have been paid by Disney or high with something. I would rather go to Ocean park which is much bigger and more things to see and do.Just to get to Disneyland you are paying US$ 15 20."
5,Easy to get to via taxi (approx $130HKD from the airport). Lion King and mickey's storybook were the best shows in the park.fantastic parades and even adults feel included in the disney atmosphere! Food & drink is a little pricey.
4,"My first experience to Disneyland n it was great. Had so much fun with my partner. From space ship roller coaster, to andy toy story, tarzan tree house, cool mickey mouse show, until the unexpected backwards train ride. It was great n very challenging, well got me screamed a few times lol. Worth to come back !! For all age.. u r welcome "
4,"I visited this superb amusement and theme park two times already. On this last visit , I took my 86 yr old father with me. He enjoyed like a child. The whole area is divided into 7 zones and each of the zones is uniquely planned and designed with the speciality of that zone in mind. Each zone has a ride, a show , an eatery for that area. I loved the Grizzly bears mining area with that stupendous ride!! The zone is planned with hot water geizers and rocky mountainous type. Excellent. Also the space ride area was too good. Starwars themed people were going around. The ride was great. I also liked the Little children's boat rides. The shows were a little less exciting for us. Because it's really for the small kids. There is a nice rail line around the park for easy travel. We bought the online tickets from the website. That made the enty super easy. Also I had the priority pass for us  that's free, my father had the senior ticket very cheap. The passes really helped us to see everything fast. U need to walk around a lot. But lots of resting places and refreshments are available to take it slow. Protect your head with hats.One day finishes like a sweet dream. Interested people can take the two day ticket if so inclined. There is also a hotel inside which can be included in the package. At designated times there are themed festivities, procession and fireworks which attracts lot of crowds. The journey from the city takes around 1 hr. Discounted tickets are available from klook dot com also. Overall, a lifetime dream came true for me. I have been dreaming of going to disneyland from the last 40 yrs minimum. I am very happy. "
5,"Having visited Anahiem Disneyland many years ago, we were not expecting too much at HKDL. However, we thoroughly enjoyed our vist. A highlight is the Marvel Iron Man experience (unique to HKDL) and also Mystic Manor a twist on the Haunted Mansion. It was quite busy the first day we went (we opted for the two day pass) but it was still manageable and the only issue we had was finding a table to eat at.... and the queue at the Starbucks for a coffee."
5,Great day out for the family. We had minimal ques and saw all of the park in one day. Going back for the second day to watch the shows. Easy train ride to the park.
4,"It's been a long time since last step into HK Disneyland. (Actually, less than 1 year ago, as I went for the HK Disneyland run that run thru the park...and I went for the 2018 edition again this time lol)So this time into the park direct to see the shows and some of the rides. (Frankly, the queue is scary; unless you go first thing in the morning, or buy  get the fastpass, 1 day is not enough to see ALL the shows  rides... ) Ok, certain things are under renovation   including the well loved Castle, and thus the fireworks at night though never stay that late.Stay for the new Mona show, Lion King show, the favorite Small World ride, the Pooh ride, ...and of course the well loved parade.As usual, magical at least for me to see Mickey and most of the Disney characters."
5,"We spent our daughter's birrhday in Disneyland. As per her this is dream come true! The shows, rides, shopping is the peefect gift you can give your children. You will also realize that there is a child in you as well. Myself and wife too enjoyed the day. Gegerally we get tired walking..but that day though we walked the whole day..the intermittent rest during meals and garden was a perfect way to enjoy the whole day.Highly recommend. "
3,"A good day out which tired kids out, but unfortunately did not have time to do much due to queues and waiting around.  Been there, done it probably would not choose to go back, especially for the price(s)."
1,"Visited from Australia. Enjoyed the rides, parades and shows. Disappointed the toy train ride was closed. Knew the castle would be under renovation. The biggest let down was that as we were leaving, we decided to pop by the gift shop to buy a Mickey and Mini Mouse plush toy (in the Chinese outfits) which was under the sign that said 2 for HKD298. When we went to pay, the girl behind the counter said it was HKD168 each. We took her colleague to show her the offer sign and she said it didn   t apply for Mickey and Mini, but that it was for other plush toys (Duffy and friends toys only). The girl was very condescending and made us feel unpleasant. So we accepted and bought it for HKD336. When we left to Hong Kong airport 2 days later, at the Disney store in the airport (we didn   t know there would be one there) we saw the same deal: 2 plush for HKD298 and we asked if it applied to the same Mickey and Mini mouse, and lo and behold the girl at that store said it did! that is, 2 for HKD298!! So how is it that at Disneyland park the store did not honour the offer when the other store did? We were very disappointed that the staff were very rude when we tried to enquire about the offer that was rightly given to everyone at the airport store, but did not give us this offer when it was clearly stated on the stand in the main Disneyland?!? This made what would have been a great day at Disneyland very unpleasant. We have discouraged our family & friends to visit Hong Kong Disneyland due to this unpleasant experience. Disney, we would like you to be more honest in your promotions and to honour what is stated in your pricing. "
5,Disneyland make you think happy thoughts & just enjoy the day! We had too much fun that we almost didn't realise it was almost closing time...will definitely come back here   real soon!     
5,What else could I possibly say about going to Disneyland that hasn't already been said. A truly magical place. A bit different from the original Disney California. Space Mountain is a combination of Space Mountain and Star Wars. Quite hysterical Hearing R2 D2in your ear while riding in the dark. The haunted house is a combination of Raiders of the Lost Ark style seating and has some of the facts of the haunted house. The jungle cruise is way better then California Disney. The whole Adventure Land is very green and Lush. The Toy Story Land is incredible. Full of lots of great rides. The Thunder Mountain is amazing and much better than California. Super easy to get there using the MTR.
5,"I was here 3 years ago and the park has a slight change. This time there is no firework at night but only parade of the disney characters. If you are looking for halal food the place is at adventure land. They serve asian food and quite resonable price. As for the ride, please go for the iron man ride and it is 3D and also go for the star war Jedi training and you fight with darth vader. For starwar fan, you must not miss this. Every ride waiting time is about 20 minutes Overall the park is well organise."
3,Whilst there was not as many rides as Disneyland Paris it was still a good day out. The light show was great. There seemed to be a lot of rides and cafes closed. We knew that the castle wouldn   t be open but I was a little disappointed about the other rides especially considering the cost of tickets.
4,The first thing on our agenda when we finished checking in the hotel was to go to Disneyland. It was a first time trip for my mom and my son. Even though we were tired from travelling we felt that the happiest place on earth would cheer everyone up. We bought tickets from klook which was very helpful. The lines were very long and we can   t seem to catch the best time for pictures with Mascots. We enjoyed the simple ride in Small World and the intense and visually interactive Mystic Manor.
5,"Our family went there, everyone loved it although it is very small. But it is defiantly Disney and worth going to for any Disney fan. There are the popular rides, restaurants and characters in the park. You can also get a special Disney charm there from Pandora."
4,"Our family of five (kids 4, 2, and baby) went to HK Disney and had a magical day. We found that there was plenty to do even with very small kids. The only unfortunate thing that happened was some inconsiderate staff hurrying us as we were delayed due to some baby issues. The other thing to note is that many shows are light on english     we still had fin but it modestly reduced our enjoyment at times. "
5,"It's great to visit Disneyland, don't miss the spectacular shows they have.  I wish they added few more thrill rides."
4,Me and my friend went here last Jan 15 this year.. we enjoy roaming around and the rides.. we didn   t get a chance to visit the other sides where the roller coaster is.. I thought they have a Ferris wheel but they don   t have.. and the castle is still under renovation that is why they don   t have a fire works display which supposed to have to complete your Disney trip.. I think it   s better to visit again if the castle is done.. 
4,"If you love disney land then this is something you have to do. Unfortunately i enjoyed Shanghai and Tokyo's Disney land wayyy better.. nothing wrong with the hong kong one, but i think its the smallest one. Basic rides. But again, if you are a Disney land fan like myself, then this is a must do"
5,"We stayed at the Explorers hotel for 2 nights with 1 day access to the park in between. This was perfect for us as we have a 3 year old only and she can not go (does not want to go) on most rides.The park is so well run and manages the thoursands of people really well. It is perfectly maintained and is truly  Disneyland . Lovely music playing everywhere, plenty of staff whenever you have a question or need help, lots of food and cooldrink options. They have created this happy place. We loved it!"
2,they don't have as many rides as other Disneys.  Easy to get to.  Charge a fortune for bag storage but there are cheaper lockers if your bag is not big. Castle is still being built so not great yet.
5,"We feel at Disneyland, like in the USA or Paris...  not that many people in winter  Fast pass are free : don't wait in line !  a great day, as usual !"
3,"There were only about two rides in each of the lands areas and several of those rides were closed. The park is small and so each of the rides are compacted into small spaces. The rides were short. The best show was the Lion King, Moana was disappointing. The lines were only 15 30 minutes waiting time. It's about $80 to get in. They have cooked squid they sell at kiosks and it tastes like beef jerky. You can take the subway to get to Disneyland"
4,"3rd DL park visited after going to both the Anaheim parks.Went in January 2019, was 19 20 degrees Celsius. Perfect for walking around. Fantasy land and toy story land were always very busy but the rest of the park was generally quiet. Longest line I saw was dumbo ride with a 40 min wait. As DL HOTEL guest we got a few priority passes. We used these for the popular attractions and we lined up basically for 1 2 mins before walking onto a ride.Highlights: grizzly gulch mine car ride, iron man experience and hyperspace mountain.Favourite show: Mickey and wonderous book.Favourite parade: paint the night.Characters: in two days we saw about 15 characters. They seemed to be easier to access than California. They also interacted better. Overall: 1 day is enough for regular travellers. Disney freaks will need 2 days to see everything. We did 2 days and went on major attractions 3 4 times and just took our time. It was much less stressful than California! The castle is getting renovated and will be completed I believe next year. An ant man wasp attraction opens in March 2019. It was a great park and we had lots of fun!"
3,"If you haven   t been at other Disney, you will have abre at time specially if visiting with children. If you   ve visited Disneyland in California or Disney World in Florida you   ll be disappointed here. It is like all Disney   s very pretty but way too far, complicated to get there, expensive and small! Very few attractions and with only the oldest classics of the park like Jungle River Cruise, Dumbo, It   s a Small World, etc. "
4,"As a local, I have annual pass and bring the kids visit almost once a month. Despite the park is not big, and it is enough for a full day travel, and the extension may take a few years later, which perhaps a second day visit as well. My understanding there are some package tour to stay the Disneyland resort hotel and have compliment tickets to visit the theme park as well."
3,Brought mum for the first time to Disneyland when she is 62. She loves it as much as I do. Bought merchandises for her to wear just like the children in d park!Toilets however can be cleaner and should have queue for elderly for the rides.
3,There are more people here than the other themepark but this one is small and not much rides attractions. It is only because of the name that people flock this place. There are other countries with good Disney park but not this one.
5,"My adult son and I had a wonderful day in Dec 2018. We are bid Disney fans. We went to China to complete his around the world Disneyland parks by going to Hong Kong and Shanghai. This park like all Disney operation was clean, well laid out, great service and well worth the money. Don't expert a mirror of LA. Plenty of people speak English at least enough to point you in the right direction. Rides were great, food selection is extensive and night activities are well done. It is a long subway ride from Hong Kong then a pretty long walk to front gate. IMPORTANT TIP do not take in any kinds of bags or purses. Put whatever you need in your pockets. It will save you an hour getting in as security lines are very long but the line for people without them basically walk right in."
5,"Hong Kong Disneyland has the magic of the Magic Kingdom but is much smaller in size. It is therefore less crowded and easier to navigate. The downside is the quality and price of the food offered in the restaurants and hotels. There is really no other option unless one takes the subway off site It is also hard to find a willingness in the employees to accommodate special diets such as gluten free. Our granddaughter has celiacs and we asked for ice cream in a dish rather than a cone. You would think we had asked for something unbelievably difficult for them to do. They would only give us the ice cream in a cardboard paper french fry container and not in a plastic cup that they used to serve sundaes in. We found this same reluctance to make exceptions when ordering in all of the restaurants there. It was surprising to find this at a place with the Disney brand, especially considering their prices for food. The actual park tickets and hotel tickets were reasonable."
4,"Why would you spend all that money going to America when you could go to Hong Kong Disneyland?? We had a carefree trip there on the train arriving late morning. We saw the Lion King show, went on rides, watched the  Halloween Parade , ate, drank and had a ball and didn't leave until after nightfall. Highly recommended.."
5,The resort was very nice and provide great experience for kids.Please check the weather before planning for the trip. We visit Hongkong Disneyland during the rainy season so it was raining most of the time and the resort could not perform the parade and fireworks.
4,"2 adults and we had a great time   ate burgers at the Starlight   went on a handful of rides, watched the big parade, rode the train and bought lots of souvenirs"
4,Was at the park for 2 days in Jan on both weekdays. Park was not that crowded and most rides had waiting time of less than 30 mins or so. Weather was great as well. However there was no fireworks at the end of the parade on a weekday which was disappointing.
5,"Being an adult and my first visit to DisneyLand, the experience was awesome. My kids were so happy to see all their favorite Disney figures. Try buying your tickets online to avoid 30 45 minutes queue even on weekdays and be early at the entrance to make most of the attractions since waiting time for attractions were 30 45 mins waiting time. A one day ticket will be enough if you are early. Look for a taxi to get to DisneyLand, they are way cheaper than UBER and off from there by 17:00 since it gets very cold around 8 9 Degrees Celsius in December"
5,Had the most amazing 4days at disneyland. They made my son who has special need and in a wheelchair feel like a Prince. Made everything easy and super friendly
5,"December is really a different kind of ambiance in HK Disneyland, they have seasonal shows that will keep you going back for more."
4,"We visited with two young kids and they called it a highlight of their holiday! It   s a v small park compared to the USA parks but still worth it. The rides were great, it   s worth getting the fast passes if you can. The best ride by far was the Iron Man ride   although there are much scarier ones! The toy story land was a winner with the kids (especially the hot wheels and soldier rides!) and they also loved the Main Street. The food isn   t great, but we didn   t expect it to be! If you   ve got kids and you   re visiting HK the park is definitely worth a visit for a day. "
5,"I'd been recommended to go to Disneyland in January as the crowds are less and the weather is great. We visited 2 days and both were very uncrowded, with 20 mins our longest wait for an attraction. Ideal for kids between 5 11 years old ! The night parade was a highlight."
3,"Disneyland   Oceanpark   Be there by 12PM and 1 day is more than enough. Boring for thd adults but decent not great just decent for kids depending on how much they love the disney characters. If its just your curiosity to experience the hype of Disneyland then please opt for Oceanpark. Amazinb rides, and many themes like zoo, aquariums, waterpark and rollercoaster rides to experience. Definitely the better option."
5,"It was January 2015 when we visited HongKng on a family trip, our first international trip of course it will not be complete without visiting Disneyland, so we pack everything that we just need for the trip , so we won't be over baggage, hahah..just enough for the 2 nights stay, not knowing the temperature in Hong Kong that time increase up to 6 degrees and even 3 degrees when we left on our way back to PH, the jacket that we brought was not that enough to insulate us to very cold weather,, and even that time, it's the longest time that HOngKOng even experience that kind of very cold weather. One lesson learned from our travel is to always check the weather so you will be more than ready to enjoy the trip. But still we enjoyed the Disneyland tour especially my daughter who loves Minnie mouse.. Hopefully we can go back again and feel young at heart again."
5,"This is my second visit to Hong Kong Disney. I remember it being not remarkable the first time (many years ago). But, this time, I think it is worth the price of admission and a great getaway. There's several Hong Kong only rides that you have to do. Comparing to Shanghai Disney, I prefer this one a little more. We spent two days here and could have stayed a little longer. So, if you are a Disney fan, do not count this Disney as the little one. It has pure Disney heart."
5,It was nice time to go there and see the parade. But the queue to take picture with Mickey and Minie was tooooo long.
5,"My husband and I had a long layover at the airport, so we left our bags at the Left Luggage counter in Terminal 2 and caught a blue taxi to Disneyland. I   ve visited both Disney parks in the States many times, so I was excited to see the similarities and differences at the Hong Kong park.We arrived around 2:30 pm, and there was absolutely no queue. The ticket counter employee kindly informed us that there was no need to purchase fast pass tickets given the small number of guests at the park that day. And she was right! The longest queue was for 25 minutes for Winnie the Pooh. Otherwise, we walked right on to rides or waited 5   10 minutes. I have never seen a Disney park less crowded (we visited on January 9th).Like all Disneys, the park is charming and well done. There is a LOT of construction right now, including the castle and construction in Tomorrowland. There is a strong focus on photographs   so many character meet and greets and photo opportunities everywhere. Perhaps this is due to the new Instagram focused world we live in. It was fascinating to see so many dressed up guests ready for their pictures   high heels, designer dresses, lipstick, etc. This is not your normal turkey leg eating guest at the Florida park. :)The park appears to be quite small compared to CA Disneyland. We spent about 3.5 hours at the park and we were ready to go (we only rode the majority of the rides once). The roller coasters were a bit more exciting than those in the States   Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars (which looks like Thunder Mountain Railroad) is much more exciting. It was also interesting to see the similarities and differences between Mystic Manor and the Haunted Mansion. There were also a few new rides and experiences that I hadn   t seen in the States.I   m glad we didn   t take a full day out of our initial visit to Hong Kong to visit Disney, but it was the perfect place to spend a long layover. "
5,"Smaller and with much less    challenging    rides than Ocean Park, HK Disneyland nevertheless really delivers.We went to HKDL only a couple of days after OP and thought it might be theme park overkill, but easily managed to keep going from before opening (we arrived 15    prior to 10.30am start) until closing after the final street parade. The family, including 17, 20 and 22 year olds, each had an awesome time. The lines were short (a Thursday in January), the weather perfectly in the Goldilocks zone, the rides fun albeit not too much of a challenge, and the vibe was ideal (how can you not get into it when fully 10 20% of the adult guests are wearing Mickey  Minnie ears or other HKDL headgear?!). I can even recommend forking out slightly extra in buying the combo food package (something I normally eschew), and definitely suggest it   s well worth purchasing online prior to going. If you can only go to one park I   d suggest HKDL on balance (cleaner, easier, fewer queues and less walking), unless you   re after more of a    local    flavour or want more thrill seeking rides. Ideally do both and make your own comparisons. Either way, enjoy the ride!"
3,After visiting Florida Disney World three times it is hard to have anything that will live up to the one in Florida. We love Disney and the magic spirit it creates. Hongkong Disney is very small. We went over the part in 6 hours so buying more than a 1 day pass is not necessary.If you just love to walk around and feel the atmosphere this is perfect.
4,"I got a    It   s My Birthday    badge and I   m all happy with it. The service crew gives excellent service and try to make everything as magical for their patrons as possible. The ride that one should never miss is the Mine Ride  totally worth it. I accidentally broke a piece of glass item in the shop, when I   m about to pay for it  the crew (female) didn   t want me to pay as they knew it was a genuine accident (Shop At Hotel Hollywood). "
5,It   s small but still huge areas and attractions to discover in one day! Just go at opening time and during week day otherwise it will be terrible experience. We were lucky to visit mid of week days that   s why many of the attraction areas not much people on the queue! 
5,"It was so nice to escape the city for a day and visit Disneyland! It   s easy to get to (take the train from HK central to Sunny Bay, on the Tung Chung line, then change at Sunny Bay, then the purpose built Disneyland line (Mickey theming literally everywhere!) to the resort. It   s around 600$HK which is around   60 or US$75 for a one day pass, and one day is really all you need. (They do sting you a little on the locker charges though). It has all the Disney touches you   d expect at a Disney park, but it   s very small and compact. I was lucky that the day I visited crowds were low. I never queued more than 10min for anything. Hyperspace Mountain and the Iron Man ride were great, Tomorrowland is probably the best for adult guests. The mine train in Grizzly Gulch is great too. Mystic Manor will seem strange if you   re used to the Haunted Mansion, but it has its own charm. Almost everything is kid friendly and Fantasyland seems to take up a larger proportion of the park than in Florida or California. It was so quiet that some food outlets were closed, but the Skyliner Diner, Explorers and Banquet Hall had good choices and plenty of seating"
3,"This Disney is very small and one day pass was more than adequate. The castle was closed off for refurbishment, so no nice pics of the castle or sounding area, the castle is also only half the size of other disney resorts. The Mickey light show in main street was excellent and very well done but sadly the night show that we waited for was cancelled 2 mins before it was due to start because of about 3mins of a VERY light rain shower. We have visited Florida Disney many times and it is obviously far superior but the main comment I have to say is that every single staff member at Hong Kong looked miserable and that they didn't really want to be there, by comparison Florida staff are bursting with smiles and fun. Not many large rides here and only two fast pass rides. We ate at the Chinese restaurant which was just average food. I would definitely recommend a visit and for those that can 't compare to other Disney parks you'll have a great day out."
4,"I assume its smaller than the one in Tokyo. Tried a few rides, not too extreme. The rain causing the parade to be cancelled, dissapointed but it was okay. Last minute to ride before the park closed. Can be expensive, but it was okay.."
4,This park is not as crowded as the other disneyland parks and the layout makes it easy to hit all the big rides in a day. Two days would be ideal for completing all the shows and meet & greets. The food options are varied and quite good.
5,Our experience in Disneyland was unforgettable. From we start until end we are happy all do the weather was bad we are very enjoy.
4,"If you   ve been to other Disney parks be prepared as this one is very small. Still has great attractions and feels like Disney. A number of attractions were closed when we visited so the one day pass was sufficient. Don   t get the add on meal vouchers though, not great value and restricts where you can eat from"
5,"My family and I had an amazing time. Yes it's smaller than the others but this it makes up for through its beauty and, dare I say it, originality without straying from the basic Disney experience. One day was not enough and I can't wait to see how it expands in the future."
5,"Our main attraction for visit to Hong Kong is Disneylaned. We are very happy with the trip and a day spent with Mickey and Mini!  Must see for any age, all the more for kids from 3 17 years."
5,"We bought the 2 day ticket   please try as much as possible to spend 2 days here. There is so much to do, to take in, to absorb and to enjoy. Go on every ride possible, doesnt matter if you feel too young for it, Go on it. This park is truly out of this world. Dont even miss the shows! Will entertain disney fans   young and old. Do everything touristy   mickey mouse waffles, star wars churro, minnie ice cream, pics with characters, toys and souveneirs. Most of all   take tons of pics. The memories will never leave you."
5,The main destination we visited hongkong. Dont forget to purchase tickets in by online before coming to void a long queue at the counter. Most of track are suitable for young children and their souvenier shop has pleanty offers. The night attraction also entertain us so much
5,"Disneyland Hong Kong is smaller than LA and Disneyworld parks in Florida but it made for an enjoyable day.The MTR train   which takes you right to Disneyland   is easy, fast and affordable.The only complaint from my husband is that there were no donuts!!!!! :)"
5,"It was my first time going to a Disneyland and it didn   t not disappoint. We saw shows of Moana and lion king, did all the rides and we also saw the parade. It was a pricy ticket to get in but we spent a whole day in the park. It was so much fun. I would highly recommend it."
4,"It was a bit of a disappointment when you have to queue up for nearly 30 45 minutes for a rides. Even you want to get fast pass for the rides, they can tell you no pass is available. Park is not big and you can walk around everywhere. With young kids you can rent their wagon for 120hkd per day. Entrance fees is comparatively high as compared to other countries. But still worth to come as the kids love it!!"
4,"Our 6th visit to HK Disneyland. Everything is in close proximity and queues weren   t too bad   30 minutes tops. Not bad for New Year   s Day. Still a shame there are no fireworks, but knowing that beforehand we booked dinner when we would normally watch the fireworks display. "
5,This is a great park which is great if you have kids under 13 years of age as it is not to big and can be done in a day if you push it. Kids and adults will love it
3,"have not visited HK disneyland for a few years. compare to last time, toy story is good place to visit. but the star wars theme in tomorrowland is a big disappointment. we queued for long time for commander at post    just one was there R2D2   Shanghai disneyland is much better here. but the 8pm paint the night parade is fantastic!"
5,"Excellent day at Disney, queues for most rides less than 20 mins. Philarmagic amazing as always. Really nice feel to the park with far less crowding than Florida. The Iron Man experience was the highlight. Unfortunately evening parade was cancelled due to inclement weather. As in the whole of Hong Kong, public transport is cheap, efficient and very frequent."
5,"We, a family of 4, (kids 11yrs & 8yrs) went to Disneyland on Christmas Eve. We had read the reviews and just knew we had to be prepared for the crowds but I have to say, we were pleasantly surprised. We booked our tickets online through Klook, which proved effortless as we showed our QR codes to gain enterance and off we went. We were inside the main enterance just after gate opening. We had been to Disneyland California and roughly knew the rides we wanted to get on, so headed straight for them. We rode quite a few of the rides with little to no waiting time and made our way around the park easily picking rides depending on wait time. We only had the 1 day, so if you do too, I suggest you wear comfortable shoes. Yes, it   s a smaller park but there   s still kilometers to walk. Ultimately, we had a great day out and would definitely recommend a Hong Kong Disneyland visit."
5,"We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel and spent 2 and a half days in the park with the kids. Hire strollers in the park for young kids at HK$120 to ease the kids walking and tiredness. A good spread of attractions and rides for old and young. Food in the Park is VERY expensive, HK$28 for a bottle of water! The Lion King and Mickey Magical Story book shows were outstanding and 20 30 minutes long to align to small kids attention spans. The Disneyland Park app came in very handy, displaying waiting times at rides and attractions as well as helping to navigate through the park."
5,"Spent a day here at the park on Christmas Eve, the experience was very magical. As always the park is filled with crowd but it did not affect our enjoyment of the day. Used the Disney app and was able to gauge approximate wait time for each ride. We came early in the day and was able to experience a good part of the park. Highly recommend the Grizzly Mine Car and Hyperspace rides. We also watched a few shows and parades. The Lion King show was particular magical, really brings back the kid in us. The evening Christmas themed shows are very memorable and well orchestrated! Definitely a magical and unique experience in HK "
4,"Average waiting time for the more popular rides is 30min. Back to the future is replaced by Ironman, I guess. Buzz Lightyear is also being removed. Hyperspace mountain is too bright and windy to open eyes and it's a crazy non stop high speed roller coaster ride. I prefer Grizzly Gulch roller coaster. The speed varies, including a backward ride. There's a cycle of high speed ride too but it's more bearable than Hyperspace mountain.Food is very expensive in the park, as expected. Average HKD120 for a meal."
5,"It was a magical experience, we had young children and they totally had so much fun. For the older children not too many things for them. The best time is at night when you get a more of a magical feel. Have too many photos, can't upload them all. "
4,"We went there with 2 days ticket as Disneyland offers this promotions, with 2@$15 voucher and free pop corn.Would strongly suggest to buy advanced online ticket to SKIP the line! You might want to compare official Disneyland with other online travel providers to get the best offer.This theme park is smaller compared to the Tokyo ones, yet as we went on Christmas holiday, around 50 mins waiting time is expected for each attraction, and in the end we can not try all rides. "
5,"We showed up at the park about 45 minutes before the opening because I was worried about traffic and the entrance to the park was pretty empty. They opened the park a full half hour before the official opening! Once we were on Main Street, we were able to get photos and do a little shopping before the 10 am opening of Tomorrowland. Some rides opened early while others opened a little later. The castle was under construction, so that isn't a good picture right now. We did the Ironman ride which was very fun and there was no line at all. It seems that since Shanghai Disney opened it isn't as crowded at Hong Kong Disney. We did all the big rides that we wanted to do and funny enough the longest line was for Jungle Cruise. Haha! Our new favorite ride is Mystic Manor, a new and terrific version of Haunted Mansion. It is really well done! Be sure you see it! We loved the park! We made a reservation at Crystal Lotus but didn't have a cute dim sum reservation so we were not able to get that. I wrote a separate review on that restaurant. We had done the whole park and shopped by 1 pm. As we headed out to go to the Disneyland Hotel around 1pm, the crowds coming in were insane! Apparently everyone arrives late and stays late. So we were very happy to come early and leave early. Happy that we went, and enjoyed it! We got discount tickets from Klook.com in advance. When there isn't a crowd, it's a pretty small park and easy to manage. Go and have fun!"
4,"We were here with our 11 year old son. It is a smaller park compared to the parks in the U.S. and definitely doable in about 7 8 hours. Our favorite rides were the Grizzly Gulch, Hyperspace Mountain, and Iron Man Experience. My number one tip is to get there right at 10:00. No lines to buy tickets to get into the park and super quick to walk over to the rides. We were there on a Thursday in January and we didn   t have any lines longer than 5 minutes until around noon. We also got a fast pass for Hyper Space Mountain in the morning to be sure we could come back again later without waiting. I would also recommend downloading the Hong Kong Disneyland app to see wait times and get a map of the park. We ate at the Main Street Corner cafe and the sweet and sour chicken and shrimp and the burgers were really good. It was easy to get here with the MTR and it took us about 35 minutes to arrive from Kowloon. I don   t think I would come here a second time, but definitely worth a visit at least one time. "
5,My 2nd time visiting HKG Disneyland...My children and ourselves enjoyed every moment when we were there...A place worth visiting...
5,"I visited Disneyland with my family and partner. My partner and sister were probably just young enough to get away with acting like big kids but even though we are all young adults plus my parents, we all had a great time. The rides were fantastic!Mystic Manor was a fantastic experience and appropriate for all ages, we went on this ride three times. Get to the Iron Man experience early and soak up everything that part of the park has to offer, it is an awesome section.We bought tickets that included meals and drinks and snacks and these were definitely the best value. There are heaps of options for restaurants to eat at so choose wisely where you use your voucher.If you're planning on purchasing souvenirs, take some extra cash as this can get quite expensive.The MTR Train into Disneyland is an experience in itself, it is a completely Disney train and make the experience all the more magical for the kids!"
5,"It is my 3rd visit since 2005Every time there is something new, they keeps updating adding attractionsUnfortunately they stop the fire work due to some refurbish for Princess CastleIt is not big one, 2 days is all you need there, but you will enjoy itMost of the attention for all years oldSo all the family will love it"
5,"We visited Disneyland Hong Kong mid dec 18, we had such a lovely time there especially the kids. it wasn't too crowded at the entrance, actually we bought the ticket at the hotel itself and this saved us not to make the queue. if you want to explore everything better to go there in the morning itself. Great rides but queue is quite long. when you accompanied with kids you have to ensure extra money for rides toy shop pictures taken etc.... but it worth the price you pay and the nice moment."
4,"We went with 3 girls aged 5 to 13, and there was enough for everyone, which surprised me as I thought the eldest would be bored. Although it is quite geared to little princesses, there are enough good rides and nostalgic experiences to entertain most. To be honest, I really wasn't looking forward to this, as Disney isn't my thing, and I loathe plastic environments, but it was well done, and much more entertaining than I'd anticipated. The Mystic Manor ride was good but the queue was abysmal, and not very clearly signposted. The riverboat ride was fantastic, largely because of the guide who deserves either an Oscar or a pay rise for her brilliant commentary. The Runaway Mine Carts ride was extremely good fun, and very well done in terms of safety. Most queues moved surprisingly quickly, and it was all relatively painless, even for a Disney cynic like me. I much preferred it to Disneyland Paris, which I found to be much more plastic and money grubbing."
3,"I think the hype about Hong Kong Disneyland Resort is more that the deliverable. The actual experience was not what I expected. The expectation was actually too much with all the video and pictures on line.There were very few characters to mingle with. A couple of them just came out a few minutes for picture shoots and headed back in. The on line videos showed Disney characters just walking around the park, interacting with people, making the ambiance of the park more Disney like. This was actually the expectation. I was expecting Cylons, Jedis, Mickey, Minne. Goofy, etc to been seen in the park. But unfortunately, we actually had to look for them.The entertainment in itself was not bad. The place was clean and the staff friendly. But the magical experience did not reach its peak.Don't go there with too much of expectation, or else you might be disappointed like I was. Worth a visit but not for repeats."
4,"Having previously been to Walt Disney World, I decided to take my kids to Hong Kong Disneyland for their first Disney park experience. This decision was mainly based on it being a smaller park so a little bit easier on their little legs. They absolutely adored it! My six year old went on every ride (apart from RC Racer due to height) and apart from Mystic Manor (which he found a little scary), he loved them all. The look of delight in my three year old   s face was also sweet. It was a fantastic warmer for the bigger parks in the U.S.A. One day park? Definitely not. We did every single ride (apart from RC Racer and Tarzan   s House) and every single show (apart from Moana) and parades, net characters, did none of the gardens and we just fit it into two days. And we were there from open to close with a stack of fast passes in hand. Maybe we were slowed down due to having little kids with us but I don   t know how people do the park in one day and do it justice. Where the park lost a star was the food and merchandise. The food was gross. That   s all I can say about that. The merchandise? Well unfortunately there were heaps of shops on Main Street but they all stocked exactly the same merchandise. Apart from Pandora which I don   t personally wear, there was nothing for adults. The variety just wasn   t there and the selection that was there was poor. Would I go back? Probably not now that it has been done but we are looking forward to the next Disney park. "
3,"I have been going to HK disneyland several times. Not much change. The parade is still the same and the attraction as well. New attraction is coming but unfortunately replacing my daughter favorite attraction. Some part near the castle is closed for renovation, make it not pleasant to take a picture. For those whom has not visited the park, it will be nice to experience it but after several times it will be boring."
3,"This place is overrated. Entrance fees are expensive, the queues for rides are very long, the crowd is horrible. Tokyo Disneyland is much better. Btw, Ocean Park is way better!"
5,"I love disney character since I was a kid, and I brought my daughter here and she loves every part of it. I love the parades, every different seasons too. It always makes me goosebump and love the music. I didn't make any much photos with the character but my daughter did. Worth to pay for the ticket for a year pass. This place is a happiest place on earth for me!"
5,"It was our first time to Disney and we had a magical time. I must say I was a bit scared about the attitude of the staff from certain reviews I read. All the staff and all the visitors (local and foreign) were very polite and we had a great time. If you are not a fan of roller coasters Disney Hong Kong is the place to go. It offers more family moments and spreads its magic through beautiful shows like Moana, The lion king, the story book. The park is not that big and can be done in 2 days. Watch out for the timing for Disney parades. Be prepared to queue up to 60 minutes for the popular rides and shows. We will surely go back to Disney Hong Kong. "
5,"Way better than the one in Shanghai, and better than Disneyland in Paris. Not very big but the lines are very long in most of the seasons , like anywhere else in Hong Kong you need to wait in a long queue to get in the ride. "
3,"We visited Hong Kong Disneyland with our two sons who are in their twenties. We seemed to enjoy it more than them! Lots to see and do, but most on a very tame level. If you prefer the more exciting rides, head over to Ocean Park. But for us, Disneyland was the happiest place on earth that day.It is expensive, yes, but just make the most of it and laugh along with all the others who are there for the day. Remember, if you are 65 and over, there is a huge discount! Normal entry fee is HKD615 and over 65 is HKD100. You can't purchase senior tickets online and have to do it when you are there. Many said that the officials don't ask for proof of age when you purchase this ticket, but they did ask us. So make sure you have this with you!Great day, thoroughly enjoyed it!!"
4,We were here at a busy time of year so there were long queues for most rides and limited express passes but it's disneyland so still well worth a visit. They have WiFi but it's very patchy. It's expensive as you would expect but the kids loved it. 
5,I   ve been to LA   this one is good too. But wait times and crowd can get to you. Getting a Two day pass helps if you have kids on tow.
3,"Compare it to universal studios, Disneyland hongkong is overrated! 1. Tickets are Expensive because half of the theme park is under renovation! 2. Food is way too expensive for a no quality product. They should have at least upgrade the taste, serving and of course presentation. 3. Photo ops with mascots is 15 minutes only. They should have additional time or Atleast post the timeline in a map direction for visitor   s reference! 4. Sellers here are rude! They will not give you unless you pay first, (as if you   re not going to pay if you order duh ) 5. Good for kids who don   t like extreme rides. 6. Picture in maze imposed limited time also. We recommend for children but not with teens who enjoy extreme rides! 7. Food and drinks from outside is prohibited. Again, as if the food here is awesomely tasteful! It   s really a waste of money to eat here. NO QUALITY!!!!! But rather pricy."
2,Our two day visit to Disneyland was a bitter disappointment. The park was so busy you could not move around freely. The average wait time for each ride was 60 minutes. There is no option of a fast pass as is the norm in many other theme parks around the world. We did not see the Disney Princesses for a photo opportunity (which was the only reason my youngest two wanted to go to Disneyland) and all the other photo opportunities were full before we even arrived at the destination. The train around the park only went one way and did not return to its point of departure. The lines for coffee and food resulted in is leaving the park earlier than we anticipated because the wait was too long. A very disappointing experience to say the least and we will not be back! Please do not visit during the Christmas New Year season!
5,"Bought 2 days pass and it was really worth every cent....easy access via MTR and it took roughly around 25 mins from Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station....we explored all the 7 theme parks....they do have halal food and provide prayer room for muslim....we did not take picture with the character as the queue was too long and it was not a regret as we can enjoyed ourselves with all games with queue time less than 15 mins....please go there on weekdays and not on weekend.....and for those planning to come here with children, take the 2 day pass...."
4,"Disney is going under a process of renovation. There are great things to come. Still, being there is a great experience."
4,"Rides wise, kids will enjoy. Tyere are no edtreme rides. Food are on fair price. Got a 3in1 meal promo w our ticket. Best to go to tge rides you want in the morning w less waiting time thennget a fast pass on other rides tgen come back later. You   d really reminisce your childhood on this one."
4,"You can get here from Sunny bay MTR station interchain tonMTR disneyBought 2 day pass in December friendly weather in first day 25, get promo for 2X popcorn 2X Disc HKD 15.

5,Went there in the beginning of the month of December. Disneyland is already wonderfully decorated with Christmas lights and many performances during this season. Not too crowded too. Highly recommended.
5,"We visited just after Christmas 27th but the long line never ended . Was great to catch Mickey and Minnie at the first stop.We booked the tour with gray line tours in hongkong , Candy and Gladys were the best . You can get there by subway ( mtr). "
4,"I've been to Tokyo Disneyland and Anaheim Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland is smaller but certainly if you're already in Hong Kong don't miss it. The Ironman Experience, the Hyper Space Mountain and the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Cars are the best attractions."
5,Visited Disney over the Christmas holidays.  Beautiful park and holiday decorations.  Enjoyed the lighting of the Christmas tree.  Definitely a fun day and so easy to get to by MTR.
5,Disneyland is every child dream place but it is always super crowded. This disneyland on the other hand ain't that crowded! YAY! We went early in the morning. The morning crowd is manageable. We manage to get to go twice on some rides. Did not wait more than 30mins at any rides. Easy to walk around. Christmas lightings were up. We saw the parade and it was fun. Snacks stores everywhere. Many shows to watch. Very well organised place. Go on weekdays and it will be great! I went on Friday and it is not that crowded.
5,"Disney land is great for fun and stuff but 3 years ago, there were rides like the Buzz Lightyear based shooting and Utopia. They were quite popular rides but Disney has taken them away and replaced them with rides like Iron Man Experience. Of course, these rides are quite good but what about the old ones? They were good too. Also, the castle is currently under construction and the food is quite expensive"
3,too many china pple pushing and shoving you around without an apology! so Traumatic. Visited last year and this year...nth much has changed. I prefer Tokyo Disneyland!
5,"First time here in Hong Kong Disneyland... my kids had lots of fun here especially the Mystic Manor and the Toy Story Parachute Ride... The place is huge but because it is too pack during the time we go, so we wasted lots of time is queing for rides and even for foods. There lots of stuffs in there   they evenhave Starwars and Ironman ride in there... my kids loved it... Met Mickey & Minie, Goofy, Chipmunks, Donald Duck and Ironman too... "
5,"Went to HK Disneyland last 17th December 2018 with my wife and 3.5 year old son. Even if it   s not our first time anymore, that magical happy feeling is still palpable.We arrived 10:30AM and as expected, we inevitably spent too much time in the first area around Main Street with so much to do and see, before realizing we had to move on to the other areas and attactions. My son particiularly loved the Toy Story Land area, given his familiarity with the characters there, we even went back there at night for a second time upon his request. We also spent more than an hour lining up to have a picture with Micky Mouse, but the long wait was worth it (had an easier time lining up for Chewbacca & R2D2 earlier).We had lunch and dinner at the Royal Banquet and Explorers Club, respectively. These venues offer great food and are good choices in maximizing your Klook meal coupon (HKD 149 per meal and you just pay the excess if any, plus a free ice cream or popcorn). As usual, lining up for rides was a bit of a challenge, but got easier towards the afternoon, so we just chose the ones that were suitable for our son. We took a lot of great photos all around the park and realized in hindsight that we should have gotten the 2 day pass instead of 1 day to maximize; perhaps we   ll do it next time when our son is older.By 9PM, the Parade of Disneyland characters got underway and my son, no matter how sleepy, perked up especially when he saw Lighning McQueen and Big Mack! It was an eye catching moving light show by all the performers who really looked good glowing in the dark with their LED suits and mobile stages. Then after the Parade, we went to the shops for souvenirs before we finally went back to the hotel via MTR (which fortunately operates until before midnight).Our recommendations: 1. If you really expect to spend the whole day at the park, best to avail of the Klook park entry tickets with meals for savings.2. If your overall HK itinerary can accomodate, consider the 2 day pass instead of 1 day if you really want to maximize all the attractions there without rushing so much (your kids will surely enjoy). Downloading the theme park application will also greatly help because you can conveniently see all the shows and at what time. 3. We suggest also that you print the Klook park entry tickets if possible so that it is easy to present it at the gate because trying to open the e coupons from one   s mobile phone can get confusing and will delay the queue (like what happened in our case). (Using the said e coupons, they will print out the official coupons at the gate which you will use to claim your meals snacks later on.)Hope this review helps!"
5,"I love the attention to design and detail here, along with all the basic great things that happen here   had a great day seeing things and experiencing many rides. Over time I am thinking they should add another park here. This is a solid one day adventure, and two days if you incorporate some rest   I think staying at the Disney hotels would be very good for that. Having come here from California, and been to the Anaheim Disneyland several times, this might somewhat pale in comparison, but still a fun experience. Also great people watching, especially for a westerner. Snowfall at the Christmas tree was fantastic, and I still love It's a Small, Small World!"
4,"My kids very enjoyed it especially Mytic Monor, Lion King Show and Story Book Show. The show was superb and we had wonderful time in Hong Kong Disneyland."
5,What to say. Everything is magical...!!!  We visited during XMas and lit brilliantly.   Everything is expensive inside.   But once in a lifetime experience...
3,"December is the best of the year toBe at Disneyland. It   s so festive , only problem is the huge crowd due toHoliday season. Kids age 4 8 will enjoy all the kids rides .. there are few good rides only for adults . How   re they have done a good job with so many activities and well connected zones. Mystic Manor was scary and funny. The big FrizY mountain mine car was amazing ... the best ride here .The wondrous magical story was an amazing show. Don   t miss it. Few very kiddies rides are there which u can easily do in any park. The Iron man sharks was a good thriller ride. Tomorrow land has a good food court and the best food was at the Explorer   s restaurant next to Mystic Manor. Good Indian Food. Very expensive but u have no Choice as outside food is not allowed. It was cold day when we visited so needed jackets. Overall a fun filled experience! Recommend it! "
5,"I would like to show my appreciation towards the staff at Toys Story   Parachute for their calm and professional assistance towards us when my daughter injured herself on the head when queuing on 23rd Dec. Although our visit was cut short, the staff leave a good impression for us. Thanks again."
4,I recommend exploring the adventure zone at first then others because the queue was extremely long. Average waiting time was about 40 70 min.
5,"We spent a whole day at Disney during a weekday. Went in the morning, and hardly need to queue. Even in the afternoon, each queue is less than half hour at the maximum. Wonderful experience and the kids love it. The shows are professional and entertaining too. Stay for the night parade! "
4,The park is very well organized. The support staff is helpful. There are lots of brochures and maps and restrooms. The restrooms are clean.Its easier to walk around and is manageable.Vegetarian food options are almost nil. Road side stalls area is smelly with non veg food.Rides are safe with safety checks. The staff checks them all before starting.The queues are long for each ride... about 40 min.We enjoyed the park !!!
4,"I was with my 2 little kids while visiting Disney Land during raining day unfortunately , we were upset that the Train of Disney railroad in Fantasyland to mainstreet was close on time at 6pm even RAINING !! it should be operating to send as many visitors as it could back to the main street in order to get home or get back to the main place for dinner. In fact, many people were wet without the alternate option but to walk all the way to Main Street even some without rain suit and umbrella ..."
4,"Visited Disney Land with my Wife and three year old Daughter. My daughter loved it, the kids friendly rides, musical & the shows. Good place for kids to go. Though limited rides for adult, however if going only for kids, they will like it and recommended. "
5,We arrived just after 10 am which is best time to arrive and went straight to farthest rides and had lots of fun in first couple of hours. Runaway train such a great ride along with space mountain. Still can   t beat the parade in the afternoon 
4,"The castle was closed! No Street Parade! Pricey food and souvenirs! When they will re open the castle? No definite time, maybe sometime in 2019 or 2020? It was unlucky to us NO CASTLE NO STREET PARADE instead a projector show and Mickey will appear sometime on an elevated stage.Though my teens got an unforgettable experience. This visit happened in the first week of October 2018. Try to choose another month and date if possible because this is the busiest season, so what you expect:1. Very very Long queue 2. Very pricey3. Very hot4. Very noisy5. Plenty of long walksPrepare your wallet, prepare your stamina, prepare for the crowd.The Iron Man experience was the best so far. The small world ride and show was just too much. Don't miss the book reading show, A day is not enough to take all the rides and shows because the long queue made it so difficult for you to finish or watch them all.Book your tickets ahead of time to make sure you won't waste even more time queueing to get tickets because definitely, you need more time to tour the whole place."
4,"This is the third time I had visited Disneyland Hong Kong with my boys. Each boys had a visit and of course the eldest had three! Each of these visits never fail to entertain us and making us enjoy every moment here.Ambience: still as fun and enjoyable as the first time I had visited it in 2013. The party mood is everywhere!Service: the staff are so accommodating and always strive to make everyone happy. They are helpful and never seems to be agitated by our request.Rides and Games: there are some new entertainment, e.g. iron man and Star Wars. Even the older games are so well maintain and clean. I still enjoy them.Food pricing: as in all theme park, food and drinks are expensive. A meal cost us an average HK$120 150. Do pack some drinks for your kids to save up on the drinks part.Disneyland HK well done! I feel so like a child every time I am back here. :)"
5,"i like the Hong Kong disneyland and have visited it a few timesthe food particularly has the option of some wonderful chinese cuisinecoupled with the traditional disneyland classic, and this is an ideal place to soenda full day, but do remember to buy a fast track pass..."
5,"Superb nice to be here, dream come true. But it was not any firework attraction because sleeping beauty castle has been renovated. Over all, this place is so good, a lot of happy inside"
3,"To be fair this was never going to rival the parks of Florida, however there is a fair selection of rides including Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain. This is geared more towards the younger Disney fan. Parades are great and there are a good number of shows and opportunities to meet the main characters. Park is very clean though staff have not adopted that American style and focus on customer service, staff were good but not over the top out to make your day magical. Worth a visit if you have a spare day. "
5,"We visited Disneyland in early November. The weather was perfect and we were very impressed with the ease in locating the rides and getting from one point to the other. The queues moved quickly on a weekday, I imagine the larger crowds visit on the weekends and holidays. Would definitely recommend and revisit."
3,"Being Hong Kong I thought it was going to be soo much better than what it is. Only about 3 'big' rides in the whole park & I wouldn't consider them big in comparison to places like Thorpe Park or Alton Towers.Happy to say that I have been there, but wouldn't recommend a thrill seeker to go there."
5,Not to say it is a must visit location in HK. Not only kids but adults also enjoy to the fullest. Well maintained rides and houses lot of theme parks within it.    Its a small world    is a must watch show. Donot come back without watching the parade and fireworks
4,"I really enjoy it. Reminder to download their apps, check out all the busy rides first and get the fast pass"
5,"We had a wonderful time. Best time to visit is during the week. Arrive when it opens  you will get about two hours of no crowds. Don   t miss Small World at night  so beautiful, wait for the clock to strike every 15 minutes. Don   t worry about language barriers, most everyone speaks English and signs are all English. "
5,"If you have never been to a Disneyland before, seize your chance: this is the most memorable experience you can have in HK."
5,"It has been a dream for me to celebrate my birthday in a very HAPPY PLACE and YES!!! It did happen...thanks to my supportive kids and husband.Well, since I am a Mickey Mouse lover I couldn't contain my happiness when I first stepped out of that Train and felt that super cold welcoming breeze at HK Disneyland; ) Fun rides: We all really had fun with all the rides. I loved the Mystic Mano and Iron Man experienceFood: Oh I find it too expensive (downside).Weather: When you plan to visit in December, make sure to wear thick clothings because it was really cold a week ago.Price: Reasonable with all the fun rides and beautiful architecture.A MUST TRY HAPPY PLACE!!!"
5,"We enjoyed our first visit to Hong Kong Disneyland. Despite having the Hurricane just a few months earlier, they did a good job to present the park in as good as condition as possible. Its a nice compact park once you get there and the attractions are quite well done...no substitute for Anaheim though."
5,"So I have now been to 4 Disneyland parks, Anaheim, Orlando, Paris and Hong Kong. Anaheim will always be my favorite, but I really enjoyed this, especially the things that aren't at other parks such as Mystic Manor, Big Grizzly Mountain and Mickey and the Wondrous book.We were there from rope drop to close (11 hours) and did most things as there were no queues early on and only small wait times later."
5,"We're 4 person were visited to Hong Kong during December 2018.The weather is about 17  c and nice weather & no rain. We're able to follow the show time table.We bought 2 days pass to visit Hong Kong Disneyland. If we just purchase 1 day pass, we don't have enough time to complete all theme park's games & activities. I suggest buy 2 days pass.For these 2 days, we visited Hong Kong Disneyland till 9.00pmBeside this, i also recommended purchase Disneyland ticket and meals coupon online before visit to Disneyland. You can save time & money.Having a happy family day at Hong Kong Disneyland."
5,What a fabulous day out we had a Disney Hong Kong. We got there not long after it opened and for the most part didn   t have to queue for long to get on the rides. The merchandise shop was amazing. The parades were out of this world. The queue time did increase significantly in the late afternoon early evening but we were tired by then so we   re happy to wander around and take in the sights. We   ll definitely go back! 
5,"This park is fairly small, but we had a full and fun day. We especially enjoyed Mystic Manor and Iron Man that are different than the other Disney parks. Definitely worth seeing for any Disney fan."
3,"Went here on December 12, the weather was cold not crowded at all. Unfortunately, if you are planning to visit the Sleeping Beauty Castle you'll be disappointed because it is under renovation. There's also no Fireworks. Also when we visited the Jungle River Cruise was unavailable. The kids love the place, but there are a lot of constructions going on."
4,"There were several changes like mickey and the wondrous book, l love mickey night musical, grizzly mine ride."
5,Disney Land lives up to the expectation. For the first timers it's a place straight out of the story book. Though themed around Disney stories and characters it has many rides which is suitable for most age group. It's a place to relieve fairytale world once again. The live shows are brilliantly performed. Try visiting the place on working days. That makes it easier to see things at and enjoy rides as per own convinience.
5,Perfect theme park especially for family so many kind of choice of arena  You can see the level of thrill each arena so don   t worry.   For adults there is also a arena like Indiana jones train and good for challenge seekers
5,Kids were extremely happy..  Snacks and drink available easily..  Staffs were attentive..  Everything were good except the specific group of people (cutting queue and pushy)..
5,This isn't as big as either American Disney's. About the same size as France and Japan. Unlike the French Disney where no English is used just French this site like all the other Disney's speak English. It's been well made and fantastic to see this island that has been reclaimed from the sea. All the engineering skills behind this fete is breathtakingly great.All the classic rides and shows and even some Chinese addictions. Staff are friendly and welcoming. Food outlets are all good and you need a few visits to take everything in unless you go when the gates open.
4,Enjoyed the parade and snow fall..pretty packed during parade though..no more fireworks as the castle is under reno .
5,Disneyland had always been a dream to visit since a small child and it didn't disappoint. Great place for kids (no matter what age). All the worlds had something for everyone. Be prepared to wait for some rides. Food and drink stalls everywhere with plenty of bathroom facilities.
5,"We went on a Tuesday on the first week of December. It was not crowded. We were able to go on the rides twice. (Ironman, Hyper space mountain ,RC racer, Big grizzly bear run away mine cars)My favourite ride is RC Racer and Big Grizzly Bear. The queue is less than 15 minutes. Park is well managed and staff polite. My 10 year old daughter enjoyed every time of our time there."
5,We had a fantastic time at Disneyland after a gap of 5 years. Some new rides were added and the night parade was awesome. We were initially sad that the fireworks at night was gone. But the night parade didn   t disappoint!! Don   t miss the Ironman ride which is thrilling. Even my 4.5 y.o son was able to enjoy and took it 3 times! Only complaint is almost all the main course sold in the restaurants and foodcourt there were too way overpriced as compared to normal restaurants in town. Sensible rule that selfie stick is not allowed inside. 
5,"It's small in comparison to LA,  but rides were fun,  and almost no lines!   We never spent any more than 5 minutes waiting in line.  The app is great as it lets you check line times as well."
3,"Lot of constructions on the way, tones of visitors inside the souvenir shop without crowd control. Almost 30 mins line up on cashier check out."
3,"Hong Kong  Disneyland is the smallest of all Disneylands.  Suitable for  young children .   We travelled with teenagers, as such  did not offer the  excitement of other Theme Parks.The Park is very clean  and well maintained."
5,Need two days to cover the entire park. Kids will love it . Go early when the park opens to avoid long queues. Throughly enjoyed the park.
5,Always stay for the final parade. Worth the while and squeeze. Grab a good spot to seat near the christmas tree and you will not be disappointed.  Shows every 15  30 mins before the final event.  Make sure you seat all the rides!
4,Was there for 2 days (Sunday n Monday) during December holidays. My daughters are happily posing with the Disney princesses n enjoying some of the rides. Enjoyed watching the Mickey and the Wondrous Book.  Food was ok in Disneyland but could have improved better.
5,"Truly Disney.....  A place that showcases about all the Disney characters....  We did a lot is shopping.  One day was not enough, need at least 2 days to enjoy the whole day.  The end of the day parade was awesome."
5,Visited HK Disneyland for the 3rd time. Experienced the new Iron Man ride which was realistic. Ant Man is the new attraction slated to be released in Mar 2019. Sadly no fireworks due to the castle is undergoing upgrading works.
4,"If you are a disney fan..so this is the place that you should go. Interesting 4D rides, entertaining live shows ( lion king ), met up disney characters, beautiful disney props ( castle ) & exciting souvenir shops. Few might think disneyland for younger kids ( definitely agree ). Adults who like mickey, minnie & donald duck can enjoy this place too. "
4,It's my family's first visit to HK Disneyland. The year end season provides both the climate and the atmosphere for christmas themed shows and celebrations taking place in the park though the day. It's a great place for children with various rides shows eateries which are family and child friendly. My only tip is to try and go on a weekday as the crowds in the weekend are understood to be really massive. I was there on a Monday in december and the crowd was sizeable with waits for rides going up to 30 minutes for the more popular ones. My thoughts are that a 1 day visit is sufficient unless you intend to go for all the rides shows and you have children with you.
5,"A pain. Over expensive. Over cheesy, touristic rip off in one centre. Felt like my entire life   s savings were being squeezed out of me. Ok for the kids but even they got bored of stuff too quickly. Needs rethinking"
4,Just like the other Disneylands but here in Hong Kong is quite small. We were there on Monday but still quite crowded.
4,"Too many places closed down for renovation. We did not experience a lot of fun stuff. We had fun with roller coaster, but that's about it. Personally, I like the shopping part. Their souvenirs are awesome, too many choices! Foods are expensive, but delicious. Not too much to say, but overall its a very good experience for us."
4,"Great day out for family, avoid weekends and July August. Nice new attractions and seasonal themes. bring your empty bottle with you, food and drink are very expensive."
4,"Always a nice entertainment, with good attractions. The only two negative aspects are the price and food options."
4,"The experience starts with taking the MTR to Disneyland. Very thrilling for the kids. Overall, the kids enjoyed themselves. Although it was crowded, the crowd control was done very well and they managed to get masses of people organised and happy. The shows were also quite a masterpiece both in terms of overall experience and showmanship. Enjoyed the ironman ride."
4,"This is our first visit to Hong Kong Disneyland. Our impressions are biased towards Tokyo Disneyland as we have been there prior to HK Disneyland. Apart from the rather small Sleeping Beauty Castle being under renovation, what stood out were how small the park was and expensive food. As it was not yet peak visitation and helped by slightly rainy weather (which also ruined some outdoor shows and parades), we managed to cover all the rides and shows we wanted in a day. Of all the attractions, we liked The Festival of the Lion King, Mickey and the Wonderous Book, Iron Man Experience and Mickey   s Philharmagic."
5,The rides are almost similar with other Disneylands too. It   s ok to go one time just to see how Hong Kong Disneyland feels.
5,God I love this place.  Not as big as the Paris one but just as much fun.  The entertainment is spot on and very well organised.  Buy a fast pass though.
2,"When we arrived there the castle was closed and some other rides were not operating, but still had to pay full price. We ate a meal there and it was absolutely tasteless, in fact the worst meal i have had for years.We ordered Shabu Shabu from the Japanese outlet. I wanted to order fish & chips from somewhere near the goldmine but the restaurant was closed.Corn on the cob about US$6, ice cream terribly expensive. My wife enjoyed visiting Disneyland, seeing a couple of parades, a couple of shows and many photos but it would have been more enjoyable if we had children. BUT i am sure it would have cost a lot more because they would be wanting ice cream, toys, pop corn drinks etc and i would not have been prepared to pay these ridiculous prices."
5,"Especially now that Shanghai Disneyland has been opened (which is much bigger) the number of people visiting Hong Kong Disneyland has dropped dramatically. Bad for Disney, but GREAT for Hong Kong people visiting Disneyland. Highly recommended   especially if you have kids!"
4,"No matter which Disneyland you go, it's still the happiest place on Earth.  All visitors have a smile on their faces   both young and old.  Very conveniently located.  Seems like all roads lead to Disney"
5,"Disneyland is made basically for children but it   s really amazing for adults too. we were there in first few of October and it was not so busy time there, still 2 days are not sufficient to enjoy the whole Disneyland. We enjoyed there every second of the time we spent there. Not only your children, you will not like to come back from Disneyland. Everything is made there is to mesmerise you. Starting from the toy train to meeting the ICONIC Mickey mouse. You can   t forget a single second of your time spent here.Disneyland is divided in 7 sections. In which only two sections have rides, in which fantasyland is for young children and tomorrowland is for adults and teens.Other than rides, you will see, ironman museum with an awesome 7D show. Another 7D show is about Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.   it   s an small world    ride in a boat is simply the most charming. Well I will not say much about other attractions, but all are equally awesome. Park is super clean and well maintained. You won   t find anything which looked dirty or worn out. Staff is very supportive. When we were there HALLOWEEN was around corners, so the whole park was decorated with Halloween theme. Entry fee has just right price tag but rest everything inside is so costly. A half litre water bottle costed 35 HKD. A mickey shaped lighting balloon costs HKD 150. Logically this balloon should cost less than 15 HKD (150INR) in India. Other than attractions, you can also shop there extensively, from a basic T shirt to a great party wear gown, a simple water bottle to soft toys, everything related to Disney is there for sale. Prices are obviously so high. A basic T shirt for 2 yr child was priced for 200 HKD (2000 INR). A doll set of 24 small dolls set back me 400 HKD(4000INR). I have not visited other Disneylands, but this one is so mesmerising that your brain will refuse to forget the instances of Disneyland. Overall it   s a must visit place if you are in Hong Kong."
4,"As a resident of Hong Kong, and very close to Disneyland, we   ve been visiting here often ever since it opened. We used to have yearly passes for the whole family. It is such an awesome escape from the frantic, sometimes    dirty    city life that surrounds it. All the normal Disney characters can be seen plus a number of new (to Disney)    Marvel    characters and Marvel inspired rides. Favourites of our family include the Jungle River Cruise, Grizzly Gulch, It   s a Small World, TeaCup ride, Slinky Dog and Mystic Manor. The staff are almost always friendly and helpful and the shows and parades are ALWAYS jaw dropping and definitely not to be missed. Watch out for the sporadic street performances of the street sweeper drummers who have an amazing drum perscusion show based on their garbage bins and cleaning implements. Also watch out for the    cleaner    who paints (using water) Disney characters literally on the street road. There are only really two possible negatives to the Disney experience. A very limited selection of western style (and quality) foods in some of the Disney resteraunts. Lastly, if it   s a mainland China holiday Disney can be quite unpleasant with the crowds. The best plan is to ALWAYS try and get there for opening time for less queues and crowds. Having said that, the iconic fireworks show is well worth hanging around for. Oh, and get there by train. Disney has its own train station. It   s the cleanest, quickest, cheapest way to get there. Have a GREAT trip to Disneyland. I thoroughly recommend it."
4,"i visited here about 15years ago and it was great then. now not so sure. average waiting time was over 60 mins. food was not good. best option was the popcorn. public shows were great in main street, especially the Xmas show.if you go make sure you buy the express pass otherwise you will wait all day for a couple of rides.."
5,"We enjoyed our two day visit to Hong Kong Disneyland. It is on the small side compared to other Disney Parks, but it is run perfectly just like all the others. The Mystic Mansion was our favorite ride. We did not encounter any overly long lines and our time there was very memorable. We were kind of surprised that there was not a wide verity of flavored popcorn's like they have in Japan. "
5,"One day is not enough to explore the entire Hongkong Disneyland. As a family with a Kiddo it took us two days to roam the entire park. When you enter the park make sure that you have your own Disneyland Map Park with you. This way you can plan your day. Watch out for the time allotted for different shows.The shows were fantastic, the circle of life is even more fantastic.There will be long queue for every show it is an advantage to get a fast pass to escape the long line. Except for picture taking with Minnie and Mickey Mouse you have to endure the long queue because there   s no fast pass for this.The jungle river experience is a must! For water if thirsty there should be water fountain in the park just locate it in the map, anyway selfie stick is not allowed inside the park. "
4,"We are used to going to Disneyland & Disney World in USA and have been several times to Disneyland Paris and compared to Disneyland Paris it is very tiny, so be under no illusion it   s a very piece of Disney and not many of your favourite traditional Disney rides. That said we had a great time, we brought a 2 day pass as there was not much difference in price of 1 day before we went, we also purchased the food package of 2 meals and a snack. The food you get with this deal is very filling and we struggled to get through all the food we could have. The snack was either popcorn or an ice cream and the meals were full size dinners with soft drink. Everything that we ate was very tasty.Possibly the 1 meal and a snack option would have suited us better.It was very quiet there when we went and hardly had to queue for the rides and didn   t need to use fast passes at all.decorations for Christmas were really good but I was disappointed that there was not much In the way of Disney Christmas ornaments to purchase.All in all we had a great time, I still can   t get over how small the castle is, I thought the one in Paris was small but it   s huge in comparison to the one here."
3,Disneyland is Disneyland and if you have been to one I wouldn   t recommend going to visit! With kids yes but it is overpriced and a little boring to be honest
3,"Took my daughter to HK Disneyland for her 5th birthday. Disneyland hotels are hugely overpriced, so we booked a hotel outside Disney. The Park itself is beautiful, so are most of the shows  I loved Magic Manor and my daughter loved the Lion King show. The parade was great, but a bit too short. A few things went bad though  lots of waiting for every ride  15 25  minutes. Kids got tired and we gave up on some rides. The food is overpriced and tasted bad  The Main Dining Hall (up to 20 USD for a tasteless meal), food stalls with outdated corn for 4 USD 4, sausages 5 USD. Actually all soft drinks in the Park cost HKD 32 ( 4  USD) and you are not allowed to bring your own food! Another point  it's close to Christmas time, a lot of Christmas music was being played non stop including Church hymns like Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, O Come All Ye Faithful, etc. Sounds too religious, not suitable for kids, a bight of brainwashing so to say. And no wi fi at the park at all. For the families with young kids I recommend 1 day visit after a heavy breakfast.)"
5,Great place for all ages to go. Went here on a week day which was good and the place weren't that busy thank god making it a lot easier to get on rides in no time. There was a lot of old people which was different showing no matter how old you get you can still enjoy Disney. Stayed here all day to watch parade so was worth it. Value for money Highly recommend. Booked a two way transfer save the hassle of train espically when travelling with little kids.
5,We had so much fun! This was my favorite activity we had in HK. It was a magical experience indeed. Big thanks to Klook we we're able to get the most affordable ticket for Disneyland. A day of visit is totally not enough especially on a weekend and you want to experience all the rides and take pictures with Disney characters.
4,"I already had my Disneyland experience in Anaheim, California USA and wanted my 7 year old grandson to enjoy the experience. We expected a big crowd, being a Saturday, and true enough, we had to fall in line for rides. We opted for less crowded attractions.In the bumper car area, the grandkid passed the height test but without notice that he had to be at least 8 years old, he was not allowed in. There were few staff members positioned to assist, and we had to get information from vendors manning their kiosks.What made our Disney experience worth it was the amazing parade. Sadly, there were no fireworks for is that night."
5,"Rides were family friendly and disability friendly, with a mix of intense and relaxed rides, exhibitions and shows. As expected, the facade of the theme park was intricate and well maintained. Food items were also cleverly designed and incorporated Disney symbols into their design. I would highly recommend families to buy a meal combo ticket (lunch dinner 2 drinks snack) to get the most bang for your buck.Please view the following photos to experience the beauty of this Theme Park."
4,"Third Disney park we have visited as usual full of the Disney magic. Hong Kong has been the smallest one we have visited but also had the shortest queues and was not as crowded as OrlandoAnd Paris. The bus service from the park to the hotels is also much better than Paris as proper queueing system. Happy to of ticked another Disney off the list, "
5,"It was a dream of mine to visit all 6 Disney parks around the world and this was the 5th one I got to check off! We had wonderful weather and it was pretty quiet during the day. We went during Halloween Time so the parades were very fun and the kids enjoyed themselves. I have never seen a Disney park offer merchandise discounts if you come before noon, so definitely take advantage of that. It is very small like the original Disneyland but is unique in it's own way. It definitely has the best Thunder Mountain of any park around the world!"
4,"Great place to spend with the young ones, better for kids over 6 years as more rides options. Our favourite is the small small world and Mickey mouse 3 D cinema show. Toy story unable to due to her height and then 2 rides waiting timing was 50 mins. Do stay for 6pm and 6.30pm Christmas light and concert shows. The 8pm parade is worth while too. Pre purchase ticket via Klook cheaper but meal voucher I don't really suggest."
4,"The family spent one whole day in HK Disneyland and apparently it is still not enough. There were just so many things to see, watch, ride and do. We arrived just after the gates opened and already the place teemed with guests. It helped that we bought our tickets online (and cheaper) as we were able to skip the ticket counters and breezed through the entrance. We were greeted by rows of souvenir shops and rows of cheery greeters before the kids raced towards the rides. Us adults appreciated that there is (already) a Starbucks along the Main Ave which provided a caffeine respite every now and then. We appreciate the numerous pockets of benches for rests and very helpful staff who consistently provided assistance to our queries.We loved our photo ops with Cinderella and Snow White as well as the Lion King and Moana shows."
5,"So we were in HK with kids and grandkids. They all love Disney but have only been to Orlando. We took them for the day here. Couple of thoughts:1. Its a very compact park, you can do it all in a day.2. Its easy to get to by taxi or train.3. While the tickets compare in price to Orlando, stuff inside is less expensive (really!).4. The VIP experience is worth it, especially if the park is busy. Be sure to get the armbands for the parade   you get the best seats possible with no jockeying.5. Weather was perfect in November, weekdays not crowded at all, weekends are crowded, especially with mainlanders since completion of high speed rail (my assessment),"
5,"What a nice place to visit. Loved it, never been to any other Disney land, so this was quite the experience.  Restaurants, stalls, games, rides, shops.  Loved it."
1,"Full of Mainland tourists, spitting and pushing and shoving. IS NOT THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH!!! Expensive!!"
5,"we arrived around 15 minutes before the gates were open and stayed all day until it closed. thats how much fun we had there! of course travelling with kids there are lots of breaks you'd have to take. we enjoyed the parades, and the fireworks. for muslims travellers there is a prayers room even with an ablution area! although its not labelled as musolla and it can be use by all religions but i should give credit for the their thought of having an ablution area. the prayer room is spacious and enclosed so our children could rest for a while while we prayed. most of the rides are suitable even for my 4 year old daughter although few are not. the food at the cafeteria were also delicious."
5,"Having worked at Disneyland in California for quite some time I can honestly say that Hong Kong Disneyland delivers the Magic! It   s a great place for a date, to hang out with friends or to take the whole family. It   s a Small World is incredible and has hidden characters from Disney movies throughout it! Thunder Mountain was my absolute favorite ride (for slightly older kids and adults) and the shows were great! We saw the Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book! Both amazing! The Moana show was ok but Moana didn   t sing so we left. Good food options and lots of lands to explore. Definitely smaller than Disney so if you start early you could see most of the park in a day. I turned in my day pass for an annual which was cool because they let you put your paid amount towards the full year! Oh and there is free Wi Fi throughout the park. Looking forward to heading back! "
5,"Hit all the rides in under 2 hrs. Love this place! I went mid day in October,and there were no crowds."
4,It   s a little small compared to other Disney parks. The castle and jungle cruise ride were closed.  The queues were short. My family had a great time.
5,We spent 2 days here exploring the park and visiting Disneyland Hong Kong. As a Disney fan we enjoyed it and the park does a great job with the whole Disney experience. Many of the rides are similar to what you would find at Walt Disney World but we had to see for ourselves the park as we are on a quest to visit all of the Disney Parks around the world. Crowds were manageable and the weather was perfect during our visit. 
5,the best every to go to the best every the best every one shold go there it the best every the best the best
5,"As i know this Disneyland is the smallest one in the world. I had visited Tokyo one before I visited here and my experience in Tokyo wasn   t that good, thus i only had a small expectation about it. But i really enjoyed here, attraction were much better than Tokyo one. The best attraction i enjoyed is Mystic manor which i felt kind of childhood innocent. The do not miss Mini Lion King musical! It   s really worth to watch! "
5,Our visit to Disneyland was planned solely for son who   s 4 year old. That we would also have so much fun was not known The whole environment is one of gala and celebrations. The different worlds created within Disneyland make for one new experience after the other. It is humanly impossible to do all the rides and there is a fair bit of walking in between the different    lands    and quite a wait for the very popular rides. You can you the fast access to plan though. The only downer was the food options. If you are fussy you should plan your movement through Disneyland to be around the restaurant that serves food that you like. The dining options are a bit pricey for the fare offered but that   s come to be expected of all entertainment parks et al. The rides themselves are brilliant. My wife is particular got nostalgic when she did the small world ride again after 15 odd years. The Iron man ride is a do not miss ride. Couple of pieces of advise:A. Plan your route. For eg. come to the Iron man ride in the evening. Nearly no waiting around that time. Plan where you want to have lunch and decide the route for covering the various lands.B. Plan which rides and attractions you want to cover or are must do. C. Get hold of the maps once you enter and the show timings. There are different shows and the timings vary. Also the popular ones go full sometimes 30 mins in advance. D. And finally see the timing of the parades. There a few in the evening. The grand finale at the park closing time is not to be missed. It gets crowded there so try and get there to get a good path side place. Honestly it   s near impossible to cover the park in a single day. Even most good ones would take a day to cover even at a rapid pace. Two days would give you the ability to cover the park in a relaxed manner. Goes without saying a must do. 
5,"We are a Disney loving family so this was a must do for us. The park opens later than other Disney parks which worked out for us because we could actually sleep in on vacation. The park is small but absolutely lovely. I found that our only negative was some pushy guests at parade time. There were virtually no lines for most rides. Our hotel gave us fastpasses but we didn   t need a single one. Most rides were actually walk on with no wait at all. We did wait about 20 minutes for Dumbo, I think that   s it. I would have liked to have seen more offerings to meet the characters. Cast Members were friendly but not quite up to the usual Disney standard. Overall, wonderful but small park, easily done in a full day. "
4,"It   s always fun to visit Disneyland!The hype begins (if you   re commuting to Disneyland) when you transfer to the Disney train with Mickey Mouse shaped windows. Children will always have fun in Disneyland. The adults in our trip also appreciated adult friendly rides. Points for improvement:   cleaner and more accessible public toilets   healthier dishes in the menu for children  English as main language in rides and of characters mascots plays We ended up staying in Hotel Disneyland as well where the amenities and rooms were spacious, clean and stayed true to Disney designs. A little pricey, as expected but you get your money   s worth with the amenities, service, privacy and security of the property, and the decor. Sharing Disneyland train and Disneyland Hotel photos. "
4,"We had a lovely full day at Disneyland Hong Kong.We have been to Paris, California and Florida parks and Hong Kong is tiny in comparison but it is a still a fun day if you are in the area.The castle is still there but is partly obscured by construction walls and a crane   it will soon be demolished for a new super castle in 2019 which is really exciting.The park is mostly bilingual with English and Cantonese (and Mandarin on occasions)   we would it hilarious when Mickey and friends spoke in Cantonese.Tips:Highlights of the park that you have to go on   Mystic Manor (a unique experience amongst disney parks with a fusion of ratatouille and haunted mansion rides), Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Train (a fusion of Exhibition Everest and Big Thunder Mountain and a launch coaster), and Hyperspace Mountain (HKDL version of space mountain). We went on each of these twice and loved them. The rest of the park rides are the same similar as the rest of the parks around the world.Mickey and the Wondrous Book is a really special show and I highly recommend you see it. Each performance was full and it wasn't until our third attempt did we get a seat! It's a fusion of Florida's happily ever after night time show and Paris's Peter Pan night time show. The live singing and performers were all excellent.Both parades were excellent and are your opportunity to see lots of characters at once. Arrive 30 minutes before to get your spot.If you want to meet characters get to the park for 9.30am. Gates open at 10 and there are lots of characters to meet on main street USA before the main park opens at 10.30   Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald and Daisy, Chip and Dale were all out and about.Only negatives of our day were the weak side show performances e.g. Moana home coming and the Christmas stage show. I'd avoid these and use the time to go on rides. Also the shops were always rammed and overflowing with queues snaking around the shop so you couldn't find the end of the line. If you want to get gifts and don't want to queue there is a hong kong disney store at the airport with the same prices and a fair bit of stock."
5,"Love the Princess , Love the show and good place for entertainment. My kids love it.. They enjoy all the ride and love taking pictures.. There fireworks and weather is cooling."
5,Cold weather around our visit January 2018. A bit raining also. Not a best time to go at this month. But we still go because the show must go on. Its a dream come true for the kids. But it will the best if your kids around 8years old and up for their have some height limit on the rides.
5,"Make sure to download the Disneyland HK App for easy MAP access and to know all the show schedules of the day. It was very helpful for us that's why we were able to pace and schedule our whole day in Disneyland. :) MTR to Disney was very easy as well! All the food inside were quite expensive even the drinks, so I suggest that you bring your own refillable tumbler so you have water while walking the whole day. Must watch The Lion King show and the Festival Parade!"
5,"Such a beautiful place that one can keep going again and again. Brought our kids there for their school break. A lot of changes, with new attractions, however, we came at the wrong time where a lot of constructions and castle closure which was a put off. The language use... hmmm Mickey talking in Cantonese was a put off. Should stick to English instead. "
5,"Spent a weekend in HK for our daughter   s gymnastics meet. We decided to reward her afterwards with a family day in Disneyland. It was great fun especially since we joined other friends there from the event. Our daughters cartwheeled their way into the entrance. Crowd wasn   t so bad but the castle was under repair so no traditional fireworks to cap the night. Instead, there was light show parade which wasn   t half bad! "
5,"It was awesome! We went on a Monday and got to see every show and ride every ride that we wanted. Wait times were minimal and crowds were sparse. I would say that my one poor experience came from the cast member responsible for maintaining the line for the Pluto meet and greet. He was quite rude and yelled at children repeatedly, then yelled at parents. A child and parent who got out of line were allowed to rejoin the line ahead of me and my son. This was also frustrating as we had been waiting for quite some time to see Pluto. I didn't find it overly expensive, it's Disney!"
5,"I read alot of reviews on this and was a bit concerned that it wasnt worth going but this was an absolutely amazing experience. I will note that i am a huge disney fan and that this was my first disney part visit.We arrived early and seemed to be at the start of tourist season. It was busy but not too bad. We didnt stand in a line for longer than 20 minutes. When the park opens you are first only allowed in the shopping area, obviously so you can buy stuff and they can make money but there is sooooo much to choose from.We went on most of the rides and went on them twice   once at day and once at night.We bought the tickets and food vouchers on Klook and this was a great savings and also really worth it.The rides were really fun and the overall ride experience was amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed the mine cart in the grizzly grouch area, as well as the star wars ride and the toy story horse shoe.The parades   we watched both the day and night parades   were absolutely spectacular and definitely worth going to   just a tip though is to find a spot about 30 minutes before the parade is due to start as there are alot of people.Also try and find a spot towards the end of main street USA where the road splits to the different parks as the last few floats and characters dont go all the way to the bottom of the road.We also managed to watch two of the shows. The Lion King which was amazing and then Moana which was great but the Lion King was definitely a way better experience.The only let down was that the characters are not walking around so they were only available for short time slots and for a limited amount of people so you had to try and plan your day around this."
5,"Disneyland is a must when you visit Hong Kong, it is located near the airport which is out of the way depending on where you are staying.We were staying the New Territories (Sha Tin), fortunately there is a bus that goes to Lantau Island Plaza where we then change to Disneyland bus (R8) which take us straight to Disneyland, all in all taking around 40 mins to get there.There are many ways to get the Disneyland the MTR, the blue coloured taxis or bus, the bus is definitely the cheaper option costing under $50 HKD per person.Entry to the park is quite expensive costing $699 per adult and $515 per child (as of October 2018) in total costing   210 GBP.Within the park there are many various rides that suits all ages, from the infamous Hyperspace Mountain to the jungle cruise.The eatery within the park are reasonable priced. We visited the park during a weekday and even though there was a lot of people in the park, the queues for rides were very good, averaging around a 10 minute wait.The parade is not to be missed and was very well put together. During our visit in October 2018 there was construction work being carried out on the Princess Castle, so there was no firework display in the evening. Overall, we have a fantastic day and out young children loved their time in Disneyland Hong Kong and it was definitely worth the visit. Tips:Visit during a weekday.Pre book buy tickets to see if there are any deals packages."
5,"Crowded but worth it.  I loved the light show at night, Christmas music was played and snowflakes flew in the air. At that instant, I felt the joy of Christmas."
4,"Entry was expensive, kids under 2.5 years free. A lot of people told us it wasn   t worth it and it will be crap however we did enjoy it. The kids are young so they rode on rides that suited their age group. Not a huge variety of food but there are a few restaurant cafes around. My only safety concern was lack of security guards or police presence. I caught a man taking pictures of my child along with other kids while watching the Moana live show. He was on his own not accompanied by a child or family. He was taking photos of young teenagers too. I confronted him to delete but he didn   t speak English. Managed to delete but this didn   t stop him doing it again. We spotted him a few times. While waiting for our turn on rides 2 other I saw two native people taking photos of my own children I asked them to stop and intervened but again people don   t speak English. They   d stare like it was completely normal and I   m over reacting. It made me very upset, angry and furious and this behaviour is unacceptable. Especially when it comes to children. When I contacted authorities and staff they didn   t seem to care. This is VERY VERY important that people are made aware and to be on alert. PLEASE WATCH YOUR KIDS AT ALL TIMES! don   t take your eyes off them. "
3,"It is a must have trip if you have kids! Got the kids dressed up in princesses for them to enjoy this magical experience. My child was given a birthday badge by the hotel and she could pin in and get recognised in Disneyland. We have received complimentary ice cream at restuarant and some staff would wish Happy Birthday.However, it is prob my last time gg to Disneyland HK as the 1) Lion King show was the same as 10 yrs ago. 2) experience of being pushed by rude mainland Chinese in queues was not pleasant at all. Perhaps Disneyland SEA in Japan would be a much better choice."
5,Loved this Disney park.  It was quieter than any of the others I've been to and retains the charm of the original Disney parks in America before they started modernising them.  Great day and my favourite of the four Asian Disney parks.
4,The best thing about this Disney land that it is allow most of the rides younger kids. I am able to visit most of rides with my 2 years old son. However if you visited any other Disneyland like Shanghai or Tokyo you might not feel very happy with this disney land as i couldn't find any WOW factor in this Disney land. Food is expensive i would suggest to buy advance meal tickets from Klook and convert them to the vouchers at check in gates. 
4,"This is one of the smallest parks we have been to. Currently we have been to all of the Disney parks except Paris, hopefully next year. Allow yourself about a half day to see everything. There are about 3 rides worth the time to wait in line, Hyperspace mountain, Mystic Manor, and Grizzly rollercoaster. "
3,"Visited this theme park 4 times over the past years. Its getting old and it shows. Time to give the place a spruce & add in more new rides, otherwise it will lose its visitors to other theme parks in the region"
5,"To be honest, we were expecting this to be the worst Disney park we   ve been to because it   s so small, but it was brilliant. It is small, but that   s part of the charm. It has all the classics you expect but with none of the stress and hassle you get in other parks."
3,"If you move fast, you can get thru the park in a day knowing that you won   t see everything. It   s certainly not packed like LA Disneyland or Disney World. Most of the rides in Small World are the same sans Peter Pan. Their rides in some of the areas are different. Food is really bad. Jr Yelper said we should eat at the best restaurant in the part, The Explorer Club with a variety of ethnic selections to order. But at nearly $20 a plate with meager portions, it was the worse Disney park meals I   ve ever had. The Jungle Ride was closed the weekday we went. They had 2 different Disney ice cream pops sold at the carts. One is blueberry and the Minnie is Strawberry for $5 USD. They were OK. The evening light show was basically flashing lights of Mickey and friends on the buildings. The electric parade was really good. We watched part of the Moana show. We were so bored and the singing was mediocre so we left. This is the 4th of the Disney parks we   ve been to and easily ranks at the bottom. "
5,"Hong Kong Disneyland is off the beaten track destination for everyone's desire. This site is full of new creation, nice atmosphere and beautiful landscape to explore while visiting here. The place has also captured our attentions and felt absorbed in."
5,"I went with my girlfriend in Hong Kong, and she had a great time! Needless to say, she lived her childhood dream all in one day. You all should've seen the looks on her face during the whole day we spent in HK Disneyland. Getting to Disneyland from Central and the way back was easy and convenient, given that Hong Kong's MTR is one of the world's most efficient metro system."
5,"An absolute must see and a perfect way to spend a beautiful day, the park along with all the shows is stunning. Very well organised and plenty of friendly staff to help you around .Food is good and they have a large variety of restaurants and caffe . There is a locker service where you can leave your belongings for the day , is secured and you can access it anytime, there is also a luggage valet service if you want to leave a case with wheels.We didn   t spend much above the ticket price as all rides are included."
5,"We   ve been to every Disney Park in the world, and this one may be our favorite. In our 4 visits to HKDL, we have loved the beautiful surroundings, the short or nonexistent lines, and the manicured walk from the hotels to the park. The musical productions here are terrific (it   s currently Mickey and the Wondrous Book), and there are other unique attractions as well: Mystic Manor (which is NOT a Haunted Mansion) and Grizzly Gulch. There are also some minor noteworthy features: this park   s Small World was the first to include Disney characters, and its Jungle River Cruise has a surprise ending. The castle is surprisingly small, but it is currently undergoing construction that will enlarge it."
3,"Being from FL we had to check it out, sadly I think we were better off spending a second day at Ocean Park."
5,"We had a great day out at Disneyland. We went on a Thursday in October so it wasn't busy at all. Longest wait for anything was about 15 minutes. Download the App and it tells you the current wait times all over the park.It is much smaller than Disneylands but that was good for us with 2 kids under 7, it was easy to walk around the whole park a few times, and most of the rides were good for the younger kids. It might be lacking if you're after big thrills. The food was generally ok and not at astonishing prices.As it got dark we went back and had a second ride on all the things we wanted and some we had missed earlier in the day. All 3 parades we good and as it wasn't too busy everyone was able to see fine. Highlights: The Lion King show (don't miss this and it's a good airconditioned break), Mystic Manor and the Jungle River cruise (make sure you go after dark, it's much better). As people have mentioned HK Disneyland doesn't really have the characters just walking around the Park like you find in other Disneylands, so if getting pics with them is your thing you will have to line up at specific locations and times. The train out there was good, and wasn't even packed after closing time (we walked slowly back to the station). Easily managed to stay the whole day, opening to close, and would definitely go back next time we are in HK. If you need to decide between Disneyland and Ocean Park, pick Disneyland if your travelling with younger kids."
5,"We simply had the best day at Hong Kong Disney. I had read some negative reviews but they proved to be untrue. We visited in mid November and the park was decorated for Christmas which made it even more special. It was my wife and I and our 20 year old daughter who went. The rides were excellent. The lines were pretty short (we were there on a Monday), the longest we waited was 20 minutes but some rides we just walked on. The shows and parades were pretty good. Except the snow show at 6:15pm. Not worth waiting around for. The park was clean, the toilets were clean, plenty of food stores (overpriced but that goes with the territory)Best rides were Mystic Manor, Grizzly Gulch and the Iron Man one in Tomorrow Land. My daughter said the only negative was that there were no thrill rides like a major roller coaster. Getting there via the MTR was super easy. If you bought the tickets online you have to go to Guest Relations on the left of the main gate to pick up your actual tickets. If this has been helpful please give me a helpful vote. "
4,"Went on a week day which I would recommend as even then there were hundreds of people, didn   t have to line up longer then 10 minutes to go on rides , we both loved the iron man experience ! Food is very expensive and wasn   t that great cost over $100 aus for 1 burger a small serve of chick wings and 2 milkshakes . That aside we were amazed by everything the lights on all the buildings etc at night gave it a truely magical experience we felt like kids again ! We much preferred Disneyland over ocean park"
5,"Great park. We easily rode did everything we wanted in one day and went back for a few hours during mid day for a second day for our favorite rides and shows. Mickey and the Wonderous Book is my all time favorite Disney show. I just wish the castle wasn't under construction, but I'll just have to go to see the new one when completed. "
1,"Dumb to go.America Street is a boring place because the prices ain't cheap and much can be bought elsewhere.The other zones are horrible,with too much people and staff not doing much for the adventure.Very unhappy during the whole trip."
4,"I have visited this theme park 6 times in my life. first time was with my mom and dad. Went three times alone and two times with my wife... This was my first theme park visit back in 2012. I was amazed and was wondering it to be dreamland. I rode every rides here. From thrill rides to the family rides. Well the best attraction was off course Ironman experience. Mystic Manor was cool, hyperspace mountain, rc racer, Grizzly mine car ride were all thrilling and exciting. Enjoyed the lion king and mickey mouse shows. River cruise was awesome. It's a small world was amazing. September is the month I recommend to visit. No long lines... Iconic castle is transforming don't know how long it would take. If the castle transformation is complete it would be my 7th visit..."
5,"Ive been lucky enough to visit Hong Kong Disneyland a number of times since it first opened, and each time I've been there there's something new and exciting. Whether with children or just adults, Hong Kong Disneyland is a great day out for anyone. Who doesn't want to have their picture taken with Mickey Mouse??? It's a short train ride from any part of Hong Kong, and there are great food outlets and entertainment for all the family."
4,"If you   re after a trip filled with coasters and white knuckle rides forget it, but if you want some good old Disney magic then it   s worth a visit. Quite a small park if you   re comparing it to other Disney resorts, the shows are very good, but no fireworks, no castle ( it   s under construction) and not many characters wandering around for photos. A good day out but a little disappointed to be honest. "
3,"Although we were given 8 priority pass from our kingdom club stay, we didn   t managed to use any of it. The queue were generally not too Long except for photos with iron man and the smaller kids ride.The priority pass Given to us were only applicable to 5 rides, it would definitely serve us better if it   s applicable to all other rides. As we have very young kids, rides like toy story parachute, slinky dogs etc would attract younger kids more and we couldn   t use it.I would think it would be better if Disneyland can share when and where the character would appear. Like Disneyland LA, more characters will appear in different time slot. These information weren   t available anywhere... "
5,"Disneyland. Need I say more? The most wonderful place in the world!Hong Kong Disney is a lot smaller than the others I   ve been to but of course there   s plenty to do. I   ve been twice, but most recently I got there as it opened which was great    there were no queues for any of the rides so we whizzed round quite quickly.I love the shows they put on there! The Lion King one is great so make sure you get to see that! You can book day tickets online for HKD 619     62! 100% worth it! It   s quite close to the airport and has luggage storage if you want to fill the day before you leave. It   s about 30 mins from Hong Kong Central station and very easy to get there. The train has Mickey shaped windows and handles!!! So cute!You can read more about it in the blog on my page. Please check it out!"
4,"Went with family , 2 children age 4 and 13.The Disneyland MTR was nice, took around 10 mins to reach the destination.We went on 7 11 2018, Weather was sunny ,no rain at all.We stayed Novotel City Gate hotel so it was 2 stations to Disneyland which was very convenience."
5,"Of course anything Disney is magic! Our experience at Hong Kong Disneyland was a memorable one.. having been to the parks in California, USA, we found Hong Kong to be much quieter and the longest we ever lined up for a ride would have been 10 15 minutes   and this was only for a couple of rides! We did stay at the nearby Disneyland Hotel, and this included some  priority passes  to certain attractions.The rides were all fun, with all but a couple having height restrictions that our 4 year old just missed out on! The only disappointment was the BIG lines to see the characters   and this resulted in us missing out on a photo with most of them! Even with a full 2 days here.. The lines close, well before they even officially arrive, and with only a couple of appearances each day, it is so limited! There should be more characters dressed up, and they should be out & about ALL day   not just an hour here & there... there could be 2 of each scattered throughout the park even.. and this would make everyones visit just that bit more magical!! The chaos in the gift shops is crazy, the best time to shop is whilst the parades are happening just outside!! I would skip back in a heartbeat and could quite easily spend another 2 days here! "
3,Had Visit on the 5th of Nov. Sadly alot of rides and attraction is close.  Besides that the place is clean and well kept.
5,Went with a group of Disneyfied adults on a week day. The park was decked out for Halloween   very nice. There were no crowds so we could go on every ride without ANY long waits. Liked the crowd  mellow & happy.
1,Having visited Disneyland Paris some 25 years ago we decided to spend the last day of our holiday at Disneyland Hong Kong. The rides were outdated and given HK love of all things electronic we expected more. There was a greater variety of rides in Paris. The parades started late   so we missed the last few minutes of the evening parade as we had a coach pick up to meet. The parades were not a patch on Paris some 25 years agoThe majority of the staff were rude and unhelpful   unlike the Paris staff. Given that English is widely spoken in HK a lot of the staff barely understood English. Putting it mildly it was an utter disappointment from start to finish.
4,Need to plan which rides you want to go on and what you want to see as it   s too big to do everything. shows arrive about 15 20min early. rides were max about 30min to 1 hour wait without fast track on a sunday. Hit the ones you want to go first early to beat the crowds. I went for halloween and there was a good 2 for 1 deal on disney   s site that allows me to enter the park a second time before the end of this year. For popular characters expect at least 30 min to 1 hour waits to take pictures with them (eg. jack and sally for halloween). disney staff give out lots of stickers and candy during halloween. the villains night parade at the end is not as exciting as the one during the day or their regular one as the floats with the villains are plain comparatively. 
4,"It is indeed one of the happiest places on Earth though the rides are not as thrilling as the rides of Ocean Park HK. This park entertains its children audience visitors than young adults so if you're a solo traveler, Ocean Park HK I think would suit you.If you're going to watch some shows or presentations, you have to run around the park so expect to have feet soar lolNo fireworks display when I went but the parade would entertain you for sure!Overall, it's very good and you'll certainly feel like a kid after visiting this park"
3,"Who wouldn   t want to celebrate their birthday , at least once in Disney ! So do I . However , I felt that Disney Hong Kong is a poorer cousin as compared to Tokyo. I supposed this comes from different management . Everyone knows Japanese are meticulous to the last details. Whilst, in Hong Kong , I suppose they have practical mindset rather than imagination. They are doing the basic normal job in a magical place .. what a waste . They have plenty of room to improve to make the best place as magical as possible . "
5,"Fantastic Experience. This is my Second time visiting Hongkong disneyland and it never fails to amaze me.The best part is the Iron Man experience for me. Superb. Also, the Castle is under renovation when we went there so We cannot have a photo of it. better go to these place as early as 930 am. Get a Map at their City Hall Area . Get your fast Pass to save your time on queing."
3,Overall the place was ok but many attractions were closed with no reduction to the entry price. The attractions were OK but nothing like I expected at a Disney Park. Only the Americans can do Disney!!!! All in all though it was an OK day out.
4,Actually I thought Disneyland would be for small kids. But it   s not. I went with my teenage that loved. Many attractions that for them was great. But be ready to stay long in the queue. And it   s a bit expensive but if you have energy you can spend the whole day there. Not my case. 
4,"After living in Hong Kong for a few months, I had not heard great things about HK Disneyland. But, I decided to go with some friends and had a really fantastic time! We got there right when it opened and the lines were quite short in the morning. We didn't spend more than 20 minutes in a line! The park is small; I was able to go on my favorite rides multiple times throughout the day, with and without fast passes. Because of its size, visiting the park is one day is more than feasible. I personally loved Space Mountain and Grizzly Gulch rollercoasters.The food was not as good as food at other Disney parks. The Mickey waffles and ice cream were tasty, but the popcorn wasn't warm and the sandwiches from bakeries on in Street barely had any meat and cheese in them. I recommend bringing your own food into the park.I wouldn't get a season pass for HK Disney because it's too small and it would get old quickly if I went there too often, but I will definitely visit every once in a while!"
3,"We visited HK Disneyland on our last day in Hong Kong, the food was great, but as to be expected over priced and the lines were a nightmare! A lot of the rides with audio only had it in Cantonese   understandable because your in HK, however, it   s a bit of a let down if you don   t understand it."
5,"I love Disneyland. Typically laid out in all the worlds. Great rides for young and old, lots of food and drink stations around the park. Most rides open the day I went. Plenty of parades and music happening most of the day. Always a fun day."
3,"We went there , but frankly speaking travelling to other Disneylands , this one could do better. We didnt see the night parade since it was on HOLD for quite some time know . Overall , It is too pricey for the enjopyment expected."
4,"Although it's not big as others, people coming here is less than others too and hence we managed to play all the rides and watch all the shows here which is great as the waiting time usually no more than 20 minutes.However, when we were here, the castle is still under renovation so there's no firework which is supposedly the highlight in any Disneyland.The popcorn here also doesn't has the special box like in Tokyo. Just a normal packaging."
2,"Hong Kong Disneyland is just too small with limited rides compared to parks in California, Tokyo or Paris. A little disappointing but the kids (10 and 13) enjoyed it all the same   it   s Disney after all!! A good place to spend the afternoon if you have time to spare, otherwise I would give it a miss."
5,"No matter what age or marital status, Disney is always my favorite place. The shows and rides are fantastic, I keep coming back. Definitely for all ages!"
4,"Hong Kong disney, was a marvellous place for their parade and shows. The rides were great for young kids. There are no real thrill rides , most rides a 5 yr old can go on , but it was an amazing park, ride lines at its longest was 25 minutes, which was great. Well worth it"
3,A fairytale place to visit when you are in HK. The easy and cheaper way to Disney Land is taking MRT.
5,"Disneyland....a childhood dream for every kid and finally it comes true.. i mean it when i say, that i was in heaven...it is the best place to be and the best time considering we went on Halloween.... i wish i could go there every day...We did quite some research before we went there, so we had a list of rides that we wanted to sit on and lands to visit. We found the Disneyland app, very helpful   in terms of the events for the day. The plan should always be to finish the to do items that you have on checklist and then have plenty of time to visit every land.Must do rides: Grizzy Mountain runaway mine cars, Hyperspace mountain,4D experience in Iron Man experience, RC race car, Mystique ManorThe app shows you the timings of the events, so we could attend all the shows and parades. Be ready to walk a lot, and wait a lot in queues if you want to take pictures with Mickey and Minnie.Most of the rides have fast track option with no additional cost. Every land has themed restaurants. Since it was halloween, everyone was dressed up in costumes, we were handed candies as a part of trick or treat, we visited the haunted house and finally watch the really cool   Villains night out parade.A definite visit to the place..where you feel anything and everything is possible. It is truly magical."
5,We were told that as we had been to the original parks in the USA we would be disappointed with HK Disneyland   but we were certainly not! We didn't go there expecting to see what we saw in the USA as each park has its own local charm. We enjoyed our day and loved the parades! Only issue is that there should be more taxis readily available when leaving the park as we had to wait for a while.
5,"Amazing for kids and teenager.... Takes all day, because a lot of venue you must visited. i am for the first time at disneyland"
5,"Walking up to the entrance of Disneyland, it   s hard not to feel your inner kid coming out and feel super excited! It   s magical right from the beginning with beautiful statues of Mickey Mouse and his friends in a big water fountain. We arrived in the morning as soon as the park was opening and went through the ticket queue fairly fast. But the crowd was growing much quicker than expected, and later on we found out we chose a public holiday weekend so the crowds were much bigger than usual! We would advise to research this before you plan your trip because it definitely tested our patience and dampened our spirits at times. Because of this, the queues for every single ride were anywhere from 30 minutes several hours long, and it was a very hot day. We anticipated having to line up at Disneyland but the public holiday really made things 10 times slower. But when your at Disneyland, not even that can get you down, it   s just so magical and happy! One ride in each    land    had the option for you to scan your ticket and it would give you another ticket with a time frame on it, so you   re able to go and do other things then come back to skip the line within that time frame. We were then able to go on all the main rides and explore each land. There were so many amazingly fun rides to experience, as well as photo meet and greets with favourite Disney characters such as Eeyore, r2d2, iron man and more. Tarzan   s treehouse is just brilliant, toy story land is every big kids dream and we were lucky enough to see Disneyland at Halloween time, which was spectacular! We spent all day there and upon reflection, would   ve planned to spend 2 full days, regardless of the public holiday. Disneyland truly is what you imagine it to be and more! It allows you to be a child and just have fun. Would definitely go back : ) "
5,"I went there with the family with 2 kids in tow on Halloween weekend for a 2 day pass. It   s my second time to visit HK DL and this second visit was surely better than the before. I tried more attractions. The kids most definitely enjoyed it the most. They met Mickey Mouse, Goofy, watched the Flights of Fantasy parade, Mickey Projection Show and the Villain Parade, Journey to Halloween were halloween features. The snacks were great too! Popscicles, waffles, eggette, etc. The staff were giving away lota of free stickers to the kids. And there was a lot of trick or treatin for mickey mouse marshmallows and gummy candies!!! Everything was great as expected. Disneyland HK never disappoints! As an adult, i appreciate places like these by their toilets! Hehehe. No smell, spotless clean, aaaaaand wait for it, free unlimited toilet seat covers!!!!! Sorry for that brief shallow happy episode because where i come from, no toilet seat covers are free! Anyhoo, HKDL is recommended for all ages!!! It   s a must visit when in HK. Most definitely!"
4,"We must have been super lucky as the day we arrived we didn   t queue for any rides   the most was approx 10 minutes which of course makes the day more fun! We managed to get on everything including the Lion King show which was incredible! In comparison, I think this park beats Paris. It   s obviously not cheap but the food is surprisingly ok and we had a great day! "
5,"  Huge area and really beautiful  With Disney Train, easy to go to location via MTR  lots of attractions and activities (Rides, plays, parade)  with App thats really helpful  also with brochures at entrance for maps and schedules  delicious food and snack"
5,"This is the best time during our stay in Hong Kong. I had booked 2 days ticket via Klook. You get discount when you book via Klook. The place opens at 10:30 am. Most time you will spend at Fantasyland. Here you have maximum number of rides and shows. Also many characters would visit you. Because you have so many things to cover so plan your route accordingly. As we had 2 day pass, we went around in liesure. Lion king show was mind blowing. So was Mickey and the adventure book. we had a great time. The night parade was amazing. Plan to sit atleast 30 mins ahead of the schedule so that you get the best place to watch any show. The cheapest way to reach is via MTR and it takes approx 45 mins. "
4,"Visited in March 2018 on a Sunday. Due to weekend, there were too many visitors and long queue for all the rides   attractions. Had to skip several rides due to their long waiting time. However, whatever rides we took, most of these were not that thrilling. There were 2 parades on that day, one in the afternoon and one in the evening. Both were fun to watch, especially the evening parade with illumination was very attractive. There were no closing fireworks, told that it had been discontinued. There are restaurants inside the park, however foods were expensive and average in taste. It is an expensive affair; entry tickets, inside food etc. all are overpriced. Though at the end it was tiring, but overall it was a fun filling day spent at HK Disney Land."
4,Felt like a kid again. Obviously smaller than the originals but still entertaining and an experience for those that havent been to the originals
4,"Never having been to Disneyland before, I found it very entertaining. The space was huge and they had a very convenient luggage holding area for us to leave our luggage at HKD 110 per piece. A lot of walking involved, so was very glad we wore comfortable shoes and clothes. We bought discounted tickets via Klook and could get in with no problem. Once inside, we went to look at the rides and a lot of them were not thrill rides, but fun nonetheless. I was very impressed with the amount of detail that went into creating the rides and their upkeep. Everything is perfectly maintained and no chipping paint to be seen anywhere!Delicious food is nowhere to be found in Disneyland, though. So it's just eating to survive, and your tastebuds are not taken into consideration. We managed to take all the rides we wanted to, and still take in some shows before the park closed. In the evening, the lines were much longer, because HK residents came for the evening with their annual passes. It can rain anytime in HK, so pack a raincoat if you have it. Even if it doesn't rain, it will come in handy on the mine train ride. The parade at the end of the day was really cool! Since it was halloween season, all the Disney villains came out to play."
5,"This is amazing loved every second of it ,  The queues to meet the characters can be a bit long especially in the heat but well worth it if you can keep your child shaded and entertained,"
4,"Visited with a 11 months old baby and managed to do some rides. It   s an all age friendly park, great for a one two days visit."
4,"We had a lot of fun in the park, and the new motion games like Iron Man was very enjoyable. However, the park was under renovation, so the sleeping beauty castle and the fireworks were not there. How I wish I could watch the fireworks in front of the castle!Note: the haunted house is small and boring, not worth waiting in a long long queue. The grey bear mine, the star wars track, iron man are my favorite. The star wars track has speed pass, which is worth fetching asap.Wifi is extremely slow. Don't rely on it! Bring your phone with the best signal, because mobile signal is weak there."
4,Nothing out of this world but good scenery and organization. What i liked the most was the robot trash bin going around by itself and talking :D
5,Nothing short of amazing! Although during our visit there was a private event so they had to close 4 attractions which I felt was a bit unfair. They could   ve given a discount for visitors for that day or made an announcement prior.
5,"Happiest place on earth, may have to agree  We had a ball   Go with your mind set at kiddy level and you will have a ball"
5,"We have been to Hong Kong and Disneyland on a number of occasions. This time however we had taken the Grandchildren with us, both boys aged 6 and 8. They had a wonderful day and during the afternoon Halloween Parade they were invited to take part, however they decided to decline as they are a bit shy. The parade was very well performed. Disneyland Hong Kong can at a push be done in a day. It is one of the smaller Disney global sites, however, what it lacks in size is made up for in atmosphere. It   s a great park and well worth a visit during your stay in Hong Kong. The MTR (mass transit railway) is the easiest way to get to the site. The journey takes about 40 mins from Mongkok."
4,Like all Disneyland's throughout the world it's primarily designed for the kids. I recommend taking the MTR out to this theme park. Like I said Disneyland is more for the kids than adults but lets face it we can be kids again for a day. I recommend staying and watching the nightly fireworks show which begins at 8pm nightly.
3,"During the time of my visit there, there were partial closure of the park due to private event on the 2nd and 3rd of November. I came all the way from Indonesia, paying expensive airfares, and also paying expensively for a 2 night stay at your hotel. But during my visit there, several sections, such as Adventureland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, and Toy Story Land.To make matters worse, the closure was done during the prime time of the park, around 2 3 pm all the way to the dark around 6 pm, and in some cases even until Disney closed. I was very disappointed in this, and I would like to see some responsibilities from Disney regarding this issue. Disney should've given a certain reduction on the hotel price and or Day Pass price due to this  incomplete magical experience ."
1,Extremely average rides. Please save your money and go to Universal Studios in Singapore! They don   t get anywhere close to creating the magical experiences they promise to! The park was too crowded with sections shut down for renovations. After paying for an entry it seemed like you are eternally in a queue for rides or exhibits that were extremely disappointing!
3,"Disneyland is one of the major attractions for Tourists visiting HongKong.However, it is very very expensive! Apart from that it is a heaven for kids!"
5,"English language travel books and blogs like to compare Hong Kong Disneyland to Ocean Park Hong Kong. Opened in 1977, Ocean Park often gets the nod over its 13 year old rival with the more scenic location, being three times larger, having a wider range of attractions and thrill rides, and for entertaining guests with shows starring not costumed characters, but live land and marine animals. Two categories in which Ocean Park is all wet, however, are food     ho hum carnival type fare versus Disneyland   s higher quality, wider ranging dining experiences     and, the deciding factor for me, what is known as    Disney Magic.    There   s something different about being at a Disney park     the hospitality, memory making, cleanliness, positive attitude, and characters and stories beloved for generations. It   s like coming home whether you went as a child or not. HKD is the smallest of all Disney parks, but that doesn   t make a visit any less magical and unique. Its version of the Haunted Mansion is Mystic Manor, which whisks guests through the Victorian home of world traveler Lord Henry Mystic. The mansion comes alive after Henry   s mischievous pet monkey Albert opens a music box that unleashes mayhem and enchantment. Another HKD exclusive is the exciting year old Iron Man Experience; imagine Stark Enterprises assuming sponsorship of Star Tours. Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars, HKD   s version of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, has a section where riders go backwards. Just for fun, enter the    Cantonese    or    Mandarin    line at the Jungle Cruise to hear those tired, corny jokes in a different language. OK, so there   s no Matterhorn or Pirates of the Caribbean, but when was the last time you ate smoked duck legs and curry fish balls in Anaheim or Orlando?"
5,You can't go wrong with disneyland when your with kids. I suggest to go here early to avoid long lines. During the afternoon lines for the rides starts to build up. The waiting time is between 20 40mins unlike in the morning its just between 5 10mins.
5,"Had a really memorable time here. Best food I've had at a theme park, hands down. Night parade was beautiful. Can't wait to come back!"
5,The main trip highlight is disneyland. Loads of fun and loads of excitement. We had a super time here.
5,"Been to Anaheim, Orlando and now Hong Kong and not disappointed at all! Another fantastic environment by the Disney team! While nowhere near the expanse of Orlando or even Anaheim, HK Disneyland still provides a most enjoyable experience for all ages. 3 adults and 2 small (5 & 3 yrs) children in our party. Dumbo still a favorite for all as well as the Ironman Experience (only in HKD). Ironman was a unanimous choice by all to be repeated before leaving the park at closing!"
5,"Truly, it is happiest place on earth. Best place to spend with your family and friends. Rides are fun for all ages and queues are quick. It is smaller as compared to Anaheim's Disneyland, but there are many, good attractions for each family member to enjoy. Facilities are family friendly. A few local staff manning the parade can be friendlier and warmer. After all, they represent Disney."
5,"Just spent 6 hours at Disneyland with our 8 year old granddaughter! This is not the first time we've been there with her, but we can see at this age, her height qualifies her for more exciting rides! Some rides were reserved for her an her grandfather, but others, we could all enjoy! Our trip was the latter part of October, so apparently it had cooled down a bit. Comfortable but warm. It is a very fun place for all!!"
2,Was quite disappointed as the castle was under renovation hence no fireworks. The characters roaming around the park was limited. The street march ended very fast.
5,"So Disneyland is Disneyland....Lots of characters to visit, lots of rides and experiences to explore, queues and overpriced food. However, you are going to Disneyland, this is what its all about.The number 1 tip we can provide you is GO EARLY. The attendance at the part litterally triples around 3pm. Between 10:30am and 2pm there are nearly NO queues at any entertainment   rides then it hits 2 3pm and the most popular rides have 30 50 mins waits. You CAN bring in water (I took in three bottles and showed them when entering and was let straight through) and a small amount of food, just don't bring a picnic. Sure the food is overpriced and substandard but this IS expected in theme parks. Just accept that...Head early, bring water, and let your imagination run away with the fun of Disneyland..."
5,What draws us to Disneyland is the exhuberance and excitement that   s created by both children and their parents while they enjoy and entertain. Hong Kong Disneyland is no different and yet different from other Disneyland   s as they go. There are unique rides and few new ones like the one we saw in the Iron Man Experience. It has been added after the acquisition of Marvel Universe by Disney.
5,"Well it took me 62 years but finally i got to Disneyland and loved every second of it. I know H.K. Disney is the smallest of the 6 but it is great, got through it in one fun filled day virtually no waiting on all the rides as we went on a Friday. My wife enjoyed the jungle ride and the cup and saucers as we always seen it on T.V. Hyper space, the gulch , the mansion all the 3D stuff were excellent , I would imagine if your taking children and want to do it all a 2 day pass would be the go and it's not a great deal dearer ."
2,"Yikes, the worst thing about HK Disneyland is the never ending same same music, over and over again, the same tunes. Omg I could pull my hair out, I would seriously go bonkers if I had to work there. When my kids were small, we went many times and I have to say, they absolutely loved it every time. We even discovered that the best time to go is in the pouring rain as no one else is there and there are no queues! If it suddenly brightens up it will be about 2 hours before the crowds return, that, my friends, is a very good tip. Nowadays we never go and stuff like that I avoid like the plague but if you've got young kids then you just have to take them, they will love it. Remember tho, it's crowded as all hell, expensive, you can't take your own food so you are forced to eat at the restaurants and even buy water and the queues are long. I used to smuggle in sandwiches under a dark piece of cloth at the bottom of my bag, you can get stuff in if you hide it well. Enjoy x"
5,We loved Hong Kong Disneyland!  There is just something so special and magical about Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland captures this well. You only need to see the smiles on the faces during the parade to know this is one great place.
5,"I spent a magical day At Hong Kong Disneyland with my brother and his family. I had reservations about Hong Kong Disney as I have been to the other Disney parks and this one is obviously much smaller than what I am used to in the context of the magic of Disney!However, whilst small, it   s perfectly formed and there is still huge variety of things to do across the park. I would say it   s particularly geared for smaller children as the size suits their ability to get around the park and do everything. Highlights were the Flights of Fantasy parade (magical), toy story land (in particular the parachute ride) and It   s a Small World (my all time favourite!). It   s everything you would expect from Disney in a really nice bite sized dose which makes it perfect for a 1 day visit. "
5,We went here for the day it was a great day for all adults and kids alike. It has good mixture of rides and shows everyone enjoyed the day.
5,"Reading online I felt there was a huge feeling of inferiority to this Disneyland compared to its American counterparts but I can honestly say I had a great time! It may look small on a map but I would say it felt about the same size as Disneyland California. There is so much to see and do our only downtime was sitting down to eat twice the whole day. I would say if you are a hardcore Disney fan it can be a two day park but you can definitely do it justice in one.My favourite rides (in order) were Mystic Manor, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Car, Hyperspace Mountain and The Iron Man Experiece**. We headed straight to The Iron Man Experience and Mystic Manor when we first got to the park and faced minimal wait time   When we returned later on in the day queues had built up but we stayed onsite at the Hollywood Hotel which provided us with Fast Passes which came in very handy in these instances.** Shout out to It   s A Small World and the Dumbo rides that hold a special place in my heart too**The shows at Hong Kong Disney were amazing too   Check out Festival of the Lion King, Mickey and the Wonderous Book and Mickeys PhilharMagic. I can   t remember enjoying shows at other Disney Parks as much. The We Love Mickey show was cool too and didn   t involve having to fight with crowds for a space down Main Street   the show is literally projected into the surrounding buildings so you can stand wherever you like. At the end of the day there was a Villains Night Out show keeping with the Halloween theme and involving popular villains from your favourite Disney movies. It was a lot of fun but mostly in Chinese so apart from a whole lot of cackling I wasn   t really too sure what was going on! (Shout out to Cruella who was giving it 100!!!)As well as the shows there were parades to see too. Mickeys Flight of Fancy was the best. Again, keeping with Halloween, there was a Halloween Street Party down Main Street which was fun but could have been avoided. The Hong Kong Disneyland app came in very useful when planning my day at Disney, providing show parade times and where they were located. As you can probably tell I am a Disney fan. I honestly had a great time and feel like people are a tad harsh in relation to this park (I was constant told not to expect too much). My only disappointments are:1) the size of Sleeping Beauty castle and the fact there was a lot of construction going on around it (   pardon our dust we are creating magic   ). As my partner pointed out the 15ft fence probably made the already small castle look even smaller but I am sure once they are finished it will look amazing and I will definitely be back to see for myself! 2) Despite the Disney Corporation priding themselves in magic and customer service I was a disappointed to not see this fully reflected in this park. Overall customer service was lacking in Hong Kong as a whole and I understand culturally it is a different world, but I was constantly disappointed in the rudeness I experienced during my trip and think it something that needs to be worked on at this park in order to keep in with the Disney magic."
3,"Small park, just didn   t feel like Disney, lion king show was cancelled to park attendees as they booked a private part all day, unfair I thought, some restaurants were closed, the castle was a building site, very poor considering we still payed full price, mentioned to Disney customer services but was brushed off with reply that I should have checked web site day before for closures! Bit crap when I bought the ticket 2 months earlier, I   d not be returning, really poor excuse for a Disneyland! "
5,"We enjoyed our day out in Disneyland, not like before that over crowed ( weekend  dilemma ). We can pleased our over the rides without long queues."
5,I had awesome fun at Disneyland they had a fun Halloween show with Mickey Minnie goofy dancing. Had A great fun day there.
4,"Disneyland hong kong was the 1st Disneyland I have ever visited. It was great experience for me, my daughter and my close friend. My daughter, who is 2 really enjoyed the places the story time. It was a best place to celebrate her 2nd birthday.I truly recommend this place, it's ideal for kids and adults."
4,"We visited HKDisneyland in 2013 when it had been opened for 5 days, we loved it. We had read recent mixed reviews and decide would revisit and so glad we did. The MRT trip from downtown Kowloon is simple to say the least and took about 50 mins. The gates open at 10am for a wander and many photo opportunities with well loved characters, the    lands    open at 10.30am. The new Ironman experience was easy for a couple of grandparents and we thought the transformer ride at Universal Studios much more exciting. Young and old would love it....youths would find it tame. The staff are all friendly and extremely helpful and do their best to make it a happy place. We visited today, midweek and there were no lines for anything, whatever rude or experience you wanted you just wandered to it. There were 3 Main Street parades doe to being Halloween I think. They were good, quick and not crowded. The Lion King Show is a stand out, it was in 2013 and still is. The Star Wars ride is just the old Space Mountain ride with a new name. We enjoyed Toy Story land. As grandparents we enjoyed watching the expressions on the faces of children mostly aged between 3 to 6 they were in their element. I can   t imagine teenagers thinking it was very exciting.Would we recommend it.....yes would we do it a third time....probably not,Still if you   ve never been to Disneyland and can   t get to USA...do it."
5,"If you are in Hong Kong and are even slightly interested in anything Disney including the  new  franchises, then a visit Disneyland is a must. All the classics are there, including a trip on  It's a Small World , while the Pixar, Star Wars and Iron Man displays bring Disney up to date. There is literally something for everyone at the Hong Kong Disneyland   even the journey on the Disney MTR is fun."
3,Much smaller than the California Disneyland but almost identical in some respects.  Can be covered easily in half a day.
5,It's close to the airport and small enough to do on a stop over.  Great for young families   it's not that busy and you can go to the toy story land.
5,"a great place to be, reat rides, great ambiencea lot to walk though but it is very enjoyable, don't miss the mickey parade at night around 7 and the light show at the castle later, both of these attractions are very well organised and very well played."
4,Suprisingly the theme parks are quite accesible with the MTR. Don't be surprised this place gets REALLY crowded. Twice came across with the mascots but what a shame we didn't get to snap photos with them. The guides will be there to stop the queue halfway so make sure to be there early! The rides are OK but I really love how the entire place just brings back my childhood. 
5,"It's possible to go around all the ride in one day if you plan to go to Hong Kong Disneyland, and the best thing about Disneyland is the fireworks and the parade."
5,"Good place to relax for adults and children, will take a whole day to view all the features inside the park."
5,"I just loved this , if you have a ten hour delay at Hong Kong airport then do this.amazing day theDisney gardens and rides are amazing.be sure to have a Mickey Mouse waffle too. It   s an awesome day and the question are not too long "
4,"The Disneyland is small (at least compared to Paris Disneyland)   so one day is enough if you are visiting on a weekday.On weekends, use the fast track facility to utilize your time efficiently.Tips for visitors.  Visit on weekday (avoid weekends and holidays)  Carry food with you   you can save time and money.  Carry water bottles   can save time and money. Drinking water available in few places for refilling your water bottles.  Avoid the photo with Mickey Mouse at entrance   Mickey will be available at various places during day. Saw lots of people wasting time for the photo   where I waiting for 2 minutes to get the photo near Grizzle Gulch attraction.  If you see long queue for any attraction, take fast track pass and come back later."

5,I   d read all the reviews before going and a lot were disappointed about it being small. Went with an open mind as we   ve been to both Disneyland and Disney world in the USA before. We had a lovely day as adults. Got around the park in a day. Most rides were between a 15 30 wait in line which was manageable. We didn   t watch any of the shows except the Halloween street parade at 4:30pm (which didn   t disappoint) and didn   t line up for character photos so the Day was very smooth. Has all the charm of the original park and well worth the visit for a Disney fan.
